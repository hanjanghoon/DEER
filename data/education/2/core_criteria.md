Clarity of Core Constructs
The paper must define and explain automation bias, overreliance, trust in AI, and cognitive load, and specify how these constructs are measured or observed within the study.

Integration of Theory and Literature
The paper must explain how interface features and accountability strategies relate to cognitive mechanisms behind automation bias, and situate the design within relevant literature from medicine, education, and human factors, showing how prior findings support the experimental design.

Experimental Design Specification
The paper must specify the full 2×2 factorial design, including:
 • Participants (teachers or simulated classroom tasks)
 • Independent variables: one interface feature (confidence display or AI salience: present vs. absent) and one accountability strategy (decision justification: present vs. absent)
 • Dependent variables: assessment accuracy, following incorrect AI advice, decision revision, and confidence in judgment
 • Random assignment to the four experimental groups
 • A detailed procedure for presenting AI recommendations (both correct and incorrect)

Operationalization of Measures
The paper must specify how each dependent variable is measured, including scoring rules for teacher decisions, identification of overreliance, and indicators of responsible AI use.

Data Analysis and Reporting
The paper must report main effects of interface features and accountability strategies, as well as their interaction, with results presented in visualizations (charts, tables) and quantitative indicators such as effect sizes or confidence intervals where appropriate.

Illustrative Scenarios
The paper must illustrate at least one detailed example of teacher–AI interaction in each experimental condition, demonstrating decisions under both correct and incorrect AI recommendations and highlighting the influence of interface and accountability factors.

Variation Across Conditions
The paper must present a systematic comparison across the four experimental groups, indicating which interface features and accountability strategies most effectively reduce automation bias and overreliance.

Discussion, Implications, and Recommendations
The paper must interpret findings in terms of cognitive mechanisms and practical classroom implications, identify which combinations of interface and accountability strategies are most effective, note study limitations, and specify evidence-based recommendations for AI tool design and teacher training.
