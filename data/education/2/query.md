Write a structured empirical research paper investigating how interface design and accountability strategies influence teachers’ responsible use of AI tools for student assessment, with a focus on reducing automation bias and overreliance.
The paper must include:
- A 2×2 factorial experiment plan manipulating:
 • Interface feature:confidence display (present vs. absent)
 • Accountability strategy:decision justification(present vs. absent
- Measurement strategy specifying how these variables, individually and jointly, affect teachers’ assessment decisions when AI recommendations are correct or incorrect.
- A results-oriented goal statement identifying which features and strategies best support responsible AI use in assessment.
