Interest Phase Definition and Measurement
Each interest phase (triggered, maintained situational, emerging individual, well-developed individual) must be formally defined with measurable behavioral or self-report indicators. The paper must specify the exact procedure, instrument, or rubric used to classify each student into a phase, and demonstrate how this classification is applied consistently across all participants.

Feed-Forward Feedback Operationalization
The paper must describe the feedback in concrete terms, specifying content, timing, format (written, verbal, digital), and actionable elements. The paper must also illustrate an example explaining how the feedback is designed to relate to phase progression, including a detailed example of a feedback item and its intended pedagogical effect.

Mapping Mechanisms to Phase-to-Phase Progression
For each phase, the paper must specify the hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived competence) and describe how each will be measured with clear indicators (e.g., survey scores, observable behaviors).

Experimental/Quasi-Experimental Design Specification
The paper must present a stepwise description of the study: participant selection, assignment procedures, independent and dependent variables, measurement tools, timeline of feedback delivery, and data collection procedures. For each measure, scales, scoring procedures, and reliability/validity considerations must be specified.

Classroom Implementation Example
The paper must include at least one detailed example of feedback given to students in each phase, including pre- and post-intervention classroom data showing how the feedback relates to phase progression.

Variation Across Conditions
The paper must include an analysis of one classroom condition that may affect phase progression (e.g., task type, timing, or intensity of feedback) and analyze how it changes students’ movement from their current to next phase.

Discussion, Limitations, and Future Research
The paper must interpret the results in relation to theory and feedback mechanisms, explain what they mean for classroom practice, identify limitations of the study, and suggest at least one direction for future research.
