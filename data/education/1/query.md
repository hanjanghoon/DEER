Write a structured empirical research paper investigating the relationship between feed-forward feedback, designed according to Hattie & Timperley’s (2007) framework, and students’ progression from their current phase to the next phase in Hidi & Renninger’s (2022) Four Phases of Interest Development.
The study must include classroom-based data collection and experimental or quasi-experimental design. Focus on feedback that is goal-referenced, task-specific, and actionable, and examine mechanisms (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived competence, task value) that may mediate phase-to-phase progression.
