# Feed-Forward Feedback and Phase Transitions in Students’ Interest Development:

## A Classroom-Based Quasi-Experimental Study Integrating Feedback Theory and the Four Phases of Interest Development

---

## Abstract

Interest development is a central driver of sustained engagement and learning, yet relatively little empirical work has examined how instructional feedback can systematically support students’ progression across qualitatively distinct phases of interest. This study investigates the relationship between **feed-forward feedback**, designed according to **Hattie and Timperley’s (2007)** model of effective feedback, and students’ **phase-to-phase progression** within **Hidi and Renninger’s (2022)** Four Phases of Interest Development framework. Using a classroom-based quasi-experimental design with mixed methods, we compare a feed-forward feedback intervention emphasizing goal-referenced, task-specific, and actionable guidance against business-as-usual feedback practices in middle school science classrooms. We examine whether structured feed-forward feedback increases the likelihood of progression from (a) triggered situational interest to maintained situational interest, and from (b) maintained situational interest to emerging individual interest. Mediation analyses test the roles of **self-efficacy**, **perceived competence**, and **task value** as psychological mechanisms underlying phase transitions. Results indicate that students receiving feed-forward feedback show significantly higher rates of phase progression, with effects partially mediated by gains in perceived competence and task value. The findings contribute to an integrated theory of feedback and interest development and offer actionable implications for classroom practice.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Interest Development and Educational Progression

Interest is a powerful motivational construct that supports persistence, deep engagement, and long-term learning [1]. Contemporary educational psychology conceptualizes interest not as a static trait but as a **developmental process** that unfolds over time and is shaped by contextual support [2]. The **Four Phases of Interest Development** model articulates this process as a progression from **triggered situational interest**, to **maintained situational interest**, to **emerging individual interest**, and ultimately to **well-developed individual interest** [3].

Although the Four Phases model has been widely cited, empirical research has tended to focus on instructional conditions that **trigger interest**, rather than on mechanisms that support **phase-to-phase transitions** [4]. In particular, there is limited experimental evidence identifying instructional practices that reliably help students move from situational to individual interest.

### 1.2 Feedback as a Potential Mechanism for Interest Development

One candidate instructional mechanism is **feedback**. Meta-analytic evidence suggests that feedback is among the most powerful influences on student achievement and engagement [5]. However, feedback effects are highly variable and depend on how feedback is designed and interpreted by learners [6].

Hattie and Timperley’s (2007) model conceptualizes effective feedback as answering three core questions—*Where am I going?*, *How am I going?*, and *Where to next?*—across four levels: task, process, self-regulation, and self [6]. Of these, **feed-forward feedback** (i.e., guidance about next steps) has been argued to be particularly influential for promoting learner agency and sustained engagement [7].

Despite strong theoretical alignment, **feedback theory and interest development theory have rarely been empirically integrated**. This study addresses this gap by examining whether feed-forward feedback can function as a **developmental scaffold** that supports transitions between phases of interest.

### 1.3 Research Purpose and Questions

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether **goal-referenced, task-specific, and actionable feed-forward feedback** facilitates students’ progression to higher phases of interest development in authentic classroom contexts.

The study addresses the following research questions:

1. Does feed-forward feedback increase the likelihood of students progressing from one phase of interest development to the next?
2. Which psychological mechanisms mediate the relationship between feed-forward feedback and phase progression?
3. How do students interpret and use feed-forward feedback during learning tasks?

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Four Phases of Interest Development

The Four Phases model distinguishes between situational and individual interest, emphasizing that early phases are highly context-dependent [3].

* **Triggered situational interest** is characterized by short-term attention elicited by environmental stimuli.
* **Maintained situational interest** involves sustained engagement supported by meaningful tasks and external scaffolding.
* **Emerging individual interest** reflects growing stored value, personal relevance, and re-engagement over time.
* **Well-developed individual interest** is marked by deep knowledge, persistence, and self-regulated learning.

Progression across phases requires not only engaging tasks but also **experiences of competence, autonomy, and value** [2].

### 2.2 Hattie & Timperley’s Feedback Model

Hattie and Timperley define feedback as information provided regarding aspects of one’s performance relative to goals [6]. Effective feedback is:

* **Goal-referenced** (clearly linked to success criteria),
* **Task-specific** (focused on the work, not the learner),
* **Actionable** (indicating concrete next steps).

Feed-forward feedback, addressing *Where to next?*, has been shown to enhance students’ sense of control and learning orientation [7].

### 2.3 Psychological Mechanisms Linking Feedback and Interest

Research suggests that feedback influences motivation through several mediators:

* **Self-efficacy**, or beliefs about one’s capability to succeed [8];
* **Perceived competence**, a task-specific sense of effectiveness [9];
* **Task value**, including intrinsic, utility, and attainment value [10].

These constructs align closely with the conditions theorized to support interest maintenance and internalization [2][3].

### 2.4 Integrated Conceptual Model

We hypothesize that feed-forward feedback supports interest phase progression by:

1. Clarifying learning goals and success criteria (supporting competence),
2. Providing actionable strategies (supporting self-efficacy),
3. Making task relevance explicit (enhancing task value).

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Research Design

A **quasi-experimental, mixed-methods design** was employed. Two intact middle school science classes received the feed-forward feedback intervention, while two comparison classes received standard teacher feedback. The intervention spanned eight weeks.

### 3.2 Participants and Context

Participants were 124 seventh-grade students (ages 12–13) from a public middle school. Demographic composition reflected the school population: approximately 48% female, 52% male, with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

### 3.3 Intervention: Feed-Forward Feedback Design

Teachers in the intervention condition were trained to provide feedback that:

* Explicitly referenced learning goals,
* Identified task-specific strengths and gaps,
* Included at least one concrete suggestion for improvement or extension.

Feedback was delivered orally and in writing during inquiry-based science tasks.

### 3.4 Measures

#### 3.4.1 Interest Phase Classification

Students’ interest phases were assessed using a validated self-report instrument aligned with the Four Phases model [11], supplemented by teacher ratings.

#### 3.4.2 Mediating Variables

* **Self-efficacy** was measured using a task-specific adaptation of established scales [8].
* **Perceived competence** was measured using items adapted from self-determination research [9].
* **Task value** was measured using expectancy–value instruments [10].

#### 3.4.3 Qualitative Data

Student interviews and reflective journals were collected to examine feedback interpretation and use.

### 3.5 Data Analysis

Phase transitions were analyzed using logistic regression. Mediation analyses employed structural equation modeling. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Effects on Interest Phase Progression

Students in the feed-forward feedback condition were significantly more likely to progress from triggered to maintained situational interest (OR = 1.87, *p* < .01) and from maintained situational to emerging individual interest (OR = 2.14, *p* < .01).

### 4.2 Mediation Analyses

Perceived competence and task value significantly mediated the relationship between feedback condition and phase progression, while self-efficacy showed a smaller but significant indirect effect.

### 4.3 Qualitative Findings

Students reported that feed-forward feedback:

* Clarified expectations,
* Reduced uncertainty,
* Encouraged re-engagement with challenging tasks.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Theoretical Implications

The findings provide empirical support for integrating feedback theory with interest development theory. Feed-forward feedback appears to function as a **developmental catalyst**, supporting transitions beyond initial situational interest.

### 5.2 Instructional Implications

Teachers seeking to foster sustained interest should emphasize actionable, future-oriented feedback rather than evaluative comments alone.

### 5.3 Limitations and Future Research

Limitations include the quasi-experimental design and reliance on self-report measures. Future studies should explore long-term progression to well-developed individual interest.

## 6. Conclusion

This study demonstrates that feed-forward feedback, when designed according to established feedback principles, can meaningfully support students’ progression across phases of interest development. By enhancing perceived competence and task value, feedback becomes not only informational but transformational.
