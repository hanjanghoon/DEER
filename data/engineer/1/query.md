Write a technical report on the Mori–Tanaka micromechanical model for predicting effective elastic properties of fiber-reinforced composites. The report should examine how the model integrates micromechanical principles to predict the effective stiffness tensor C∗C^*C∗, emphasizing theoretical foundations, scope, and practical design relevance. It should evaluate how the Eshelby strain-concentration framework enables homogenization, how material contrasts and volume fractions influence composite response, and how fiber orientation affects predicted anisotropy. The paper must also assess the model’s assumptions, range of validity, and comparative performance against alternative homogenization approaches under realistic engineering conditions.
