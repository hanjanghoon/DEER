1. Theoretical Framework and Derivation
The report must establish micromechanical principles, including volume averaging and representative volume elements. A complete derivation of the effective stiffness tensor C* must be presented, showing explicit steps from constituent properties to the final expression, with correct tensor operations and dimensional consistency.

2. Eshelby Solution and Strain Concentration
The analysis must explain the Eshelby tensor’s role and contain a derivation of the strain concentration tensor A, showing its dependence on the Eshelby tensor S and constituent stiffness. The relationship among A, the identity tensor I, and material properties must be developed, with justification for using the matrix as the reference medium.

3. Complete Formulation
The final expression for the effective stiffness tensor must be stated in a mathematically rigorous form, e.g., C* = Cm + Vf(Cf − Cm) A [Vm I + Vf A]^(-1) or an algebraically equivalent formulation. All tensor operations, inversions, and algebraic manipulations must be properly defined, with verified limiting cases and physical consistency.

4. Orientation Effects
The report must address unidirectional and randomly oriented fiber distributions, explain how orientation affects symmetry (orthotropic, transversely isotropic, isotropic), and describe the orientation-averaging procedure for random distributions.

5. Model Assumptions and Validity
All key assumptions must be stated explicitly (ellipsoidal inclusions, perfect bonding, linear elasticity, concentration limits). The report must quantify and justify the model’s accuracy range in terms of fiber volume fraction and property contrast, and discuss breakdown conditions at high concentrations.

6. Comparative Analysis
The report must include comparison with at least two alternative models (e.g., Voigt–Reuss bounds, Hashin–Shtrikman bounds, self-consistent scheme), identifying scenarios where Mori–Tanaka offers advantages or exhibits limitations.

7. Numerical Implementation
The computational procedure must be outlined (matrix operations, tensor contractions, numerical stability). At least one composite system with realistic parameters must be included, reporting effective elastic constants.

8. Critical Assessment
The report must present a balanced evaluation of strengths and limitations, noting scenarios where predictions deviate from experiments (fiber clustering, size effects, high concentrations) and giving practical recommendations for appropriate use.
