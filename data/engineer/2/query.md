Write a technical report on the functional roles of positive and negative bypass notches in sheet-metal stamping die design for multi-stage cutting/forming contexts, centering on the mechanics of sheet-metal shearing and edge-zone phenomena when cut paths interact or overlap, and positioning bypass notches within the broader landscape of edge-quality and flow-control strategies under industrial constraints (materials, thicknesses, clearances, sequencing). The report should address how overlap and interaction conditions in multi-stage tooling lead to the introduction of positive and negative bypass notches, differentiating their functions and comparing them with alternative edge-quality or flow-control strategies.
