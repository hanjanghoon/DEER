Mechanics & Edge States
The paper must define sheet-metal shearing, the four canonical edge zones (rollover, burnish, fracture, and burr), and parameter sensitivities, and illustrate how process parameters map to edge-state transitions.

Overlap/Interaction Analysis
The report should specify the geometry/process conditions that create overlap/interaction zones in multi-stage tooling and depict the associated stress/flow fields and defect modes without assuming a unique mechanism a priori.

Positive vs. Negative Bypass Notches
The paper must distinguish the geometries and placement regimes of positive vs. negative notches and describe the local mechanical effects (stress redistribution, flow diversion) using defensible models or evidence.

Alternatives & Trade-offs
The report must compare bypass notches to alternative edge-quality/flow-control strategies, stating applicability limits and trade-offs supported by data or literature.

Material/Process Dependence
The paper must enumerate how material properties (strength, ductility, thickness) and process parameters condition the efficacy of bypass notches, with design ranges or charts where possible.

Decision Criteria & Implementation
The report should specify concrete decision criteria and dimensional/placement rules for when bypass notches are warranted in an industrial workflow, and the measurable metrics used to judge success.

Industrial Validation
The paper must include at least one case study showing quantitative pre/post improvements (e.g., burr height, rollover %, downstream defects, cost/throughput), with limits and failure modes noted.
