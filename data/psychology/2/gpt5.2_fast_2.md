# Are Behavioral, Psychological, and Neural Explanations of Learned Fear Independent or Descriptively Redundant?

## An Empirical Multilevel Investigation

---

## Abstract

Learned fear has been explained at multiple levels of analysis: behavioral (observable fear responses), psychological (associative learning and subjective expectancy), and neural (activation of specific circuits such as the amygdala–periaqueductal gray pathway). A long-standing philosophical and scientific debate concerns whether these explanations represent independent hypotheses that can be empirically dissociated, or whether they are merely different descriptive vocabularies referring to the same underlying process. This paper presents an empirical framework and a synthesis of experimental evidence addressing two critical dissociation questions: (1) whether a behavioral fear response can occur without psychological conditioning, and (2) whether psychological conditioning can occur without activation of the canonical neural fear pathway. We review and integrate findings from human and animal studies using fear conditioning, lesion methods, pharmacological manipulation, neuroimaging, and subjective report. We propose a multilevel experimental design with measurable outcomes at all three levels and evaluate evidence from disruption studies. The results support partial independence between levels: behavioral fear can occur without conscious associative learning, and psychological conditioning can persist in the absence of canonical amygdala activation. These findings suggest that behavioral, psychological, and neural explanations are neither fully independent nor merely redundant descriptions, but rather constitute partially autonomous explanatory frameworks linked by non-reductive constraints.

## 1. Introduction

Fear learning is one of the most extensively studied phenomena in psychology and neuroscience. Classical fear conditioning paradigms—where a neutral stimulus (CS) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US)—have been central to theories of emotion, learning, and psychopathology [1]. Traditionally, explanations of learned fear are offered at three levels:

1. **Behavioral**: Observable responses such as freezing, avoidance, startle potentiation, or verbal reports like “I became afraid.”
2. **Psychological**: Internal processes such as associative learning, expectancy formation, and subjective awareness of stimulus contingencies.
3. **Neural**: Activity within specific brain circuits, most prominently the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and their cortical modulators.

Whether these levels correspond to distinct causal hypotheses or to different descriptive lenses on a single mechanism remains unresolved. Reductionist approaches often assume that neural explanations subsume psychological and behavioral ones [2], while pluralist approaches argue that each level captures autonomous regularities [3].

This paper addresses this debate empirically by focusing on two dissociation questions central to learned fear:

* **Q1**: Can a behavioral fear response occur without psychological conditioning?
* **Q2**: Can psychological conditioning occur without activation of the canonical neural fear pathway?

By reviewing existing empirical evidence and proposing an integrated experimental design, we assess whether disrupting one level selectively alters the others, thereby clarifying the explanatory status of each level.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Levels of Explanation in Cognitive Science

The distinction between behavioral, psychological, and neural explanations mirrors broader debates about levels of explanation in cognitive science and philosophy of mind [4]. Marr’s tri-level framework—computational, algorithmic, and implementational—argues that explanations at different levels answer different questions and are not straightforwardly reducible [5]. In affective neuroscience, similar arguments apply: behavioral regularities, psychological constructs, and neural mechanisms may be related without being identical.

### 2.2 Learned Fear as a Model System

Learned fear is particularly well suited to this inquiry because:

* Behavioral outputs are easily quantified (e.g., freezing duration, skin conductance).
* Psychological states can be assessed via expectancy ratings and contingency awareness.
* Neural correlates are well-characterized, especially the amygdala-centered circuitry [6].

This convergence has led some to assume explanatory equivalence across levels. However, dissociations reported in the literature challenge this assumption.

## 3. Behavioral Fear Without Psychological Conditioning

### 3.1 Defining Behavioral Fear

Behavioral fear refers to observable responses indicative of threat processing, such as freezing in rodents or autonomic arousal (e.g., skin conductance response, SCR) in humans [7]. Importantly, these responses can occur independently of verbal report or conscious awareness.

### 3.2 Evidence from Subliminal Conditioning

Multiple studies have demonstrated fear responses elicited by conditioned stimuli presented below the threshold of conscious awareness. In masked conditioning paradigms, participants show enhanced SCRs to a CS+ despite denying awareness of the CS–US contingency [8]. This suggests that behavioral fear responses can emerge without explicit psychological conditioning.

### 3.3 Amygdala-Mediated Automaticity

Neuroimaging studies show that subliminally presented fear-conditioned stimuli activate the amygdala even when participants report no awareness or expectancy [9]. Behaviorally, this manifests as avoidance or autonomic arousal, indicating fear expression without conscious associative knowledge.

### 3.4 Animal Models and Habitual Fear

In rodents, fear responses can persist even after devaluation of the US or disruption of hippocampal-dependent contextual learning, suggesting that behavioral fear can be maintained through stimulus–response mechanisms rather than cognitive associations [10].

### 3.5 Implications

These findings indicate that behavioral fear responses do not require psychological conditioning defined as conscious or reportable associative learning. Thus, at least one form of dissociation exists between behavioral and psychological levels.

## 4. Psychological Conditioning Without Canonical Neural Pathways

### 4.1 Psychological Conditioning Defined

Psychological conditioning refers to the acquisition of expectations or beliefs about stimulus contingencies, often measured via verbal report or expectancy ratings [11].

### 4.2 Amygdala Lesion Studies

Seminal studies of patients with bilateral amygdala damage reveal a striking dissociation: such patients fail to exhibit normal fear-potentiated startle or SCRs, yet can verbally report the CS–US association [12]. This indicates intact psychological conditioning despite absent behavioral fear.

### 4.3 Neuroimaging Evidence

Functional MRI studies show that contingency awareness correlates more strongly with activity in prefrontal and hippocampal regions than with the amygdala [13]. In some cases, explicit learning occurs even when amygdala activation is minimal or absent.

### 4.4 Pharmacological Disruption

Administration of anxiolytics or beta-adrenergic blockers can reduce physiological fear responses without abolishing explicit knowledge of contingencies [14]. Conversely, manipulations impairing hippocampal function can disrupt explicit learning while sparing fear responses.

### 4.5 Implications

These findings demonstrate that psychological conditioning can occur without activation of the canonical amygdala–PAG pathway, supporting partial independence between psychological and neural explanations.

## 5. Neural Explanations and Their Limits

### 5.1 Canonical Fear Circuitry

The amygdala has been central to neural theories of fear, receiving sensory input and projecting to brainstem regions responsible for defensive responses [15]. The PAG mediates freezing and autonomic responses, while cortical regions modulate fear expression.

### 5.2 Multiple Neural Pathways

Recent work challenges the idea of a single fear pathway. Alternative circuits involving the BNST, insula, and prefrontal cortex contribute to sustained anxiety and contextual fear [16]. Thus, “absence of amygdala activation” does not imply absence of neural implementation.

### 5.3 Degeneracy and Neural Pluralism

Neural degeneracy—the capacity for different neural structures to support similar functions—suggests that psychological conditioning may be implemented by multiple neural routes [17]. This undermines strict neural reductionism.

## 6. Proposed Empirical Study

### 6.1 Experimental Design

We propose a within-subject human fear conditioning experiment with three manipulations:

1. **Behavioral disruption**: Startle pathway inhibition via muscle relaxants.
2. **Psychological disruption**: Cognitive load to impair contingency awareness.
3. **Neural disruption**: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting amygdala-connected prefrontal regions.

### 6.2 Measurable Outcomes

* **Behavioral**: SCR, startle reflex, avoidance choices.
* **Psychological**: Expectancy ratings, verbal contingency reports.
* **Neural**: fMRI activation in amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex.

### 6.3 Hypotheses

* Behavioral responses will persist under psychological disruption.
* Psychological conditioning will persist under partial neural disruption.
* Full disruption across all levels will require combined interventions.

---

## 7. Results Synthesis and Interpretation

Synthesizing existing empirical findings with the proposed framework suggests that disrupting one level does not uniformly abolish the others. Instead, selective impairments yield predictable dissociations:

* Behavioral fear without awareness.
* Awareness without fear expression.
* Neural activity without overt behavior.

This pattern supports a model of **partial independence with constraint** rather than identity or full autonomy.

## 8. Philosophical Implications

### 8.1 Against Reductive Identity

If behavioral, psychological, and neural explanations were merely different descriptions of the same phenomenon, dissociations should not occur. The empirical evidence contradicts this expectation [18].

### 8.2 Against Strong Independence

However, the levels are not fully independent: manipulations at one level often probabilistically influence the others. This supports a non-reductive physicalist view where levels are linked but not identical [19].

### 8.3 Explanatory Pluralism

Learned fear exemplifies explanatory pluralism, where different vocabularies capture different regularities relevant to prediction, intervention, and understanding [20].

---

## 9. Conclusion

This investigation demonstrates that behavioral, psychological, and neural explanations of learned fear are neither strictly independent hypotheses nor merely alternative descriptions of a single process. Instead, they form partially autonomous explanatory levels connected by systematic but non-identity relations. Behavioral fear can occur without psychological conditioning, and psychological conditioning can occur without canonical neural pathway activation. These findings have significant implications for affective neuroscience, clinical intervention, and the philosophy of explanation.
