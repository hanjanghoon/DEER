Write an empirical research paper whether behavioral, psychological, and neural explanations of learned fear are independent or simply different ways of describing the same phenomenon. Specifically, investigate if:

- A behavioral fear response (e.g., “became afraid”) can occur without the expected psychological conditioning (learned association).
- Psychological conditioning can occur without activation of the proposed neural pathway (e.g., amygdala or PAG).

The study should include measurable outcomes at all three levels—behavioral, psychological, and neural—and evaluate whether disrupting one level alters the others. This investigation will clarify whether these explanatory levels are independent hypotheses or different descriptive vocabularies for the same underlying process.
