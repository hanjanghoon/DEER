Generate an academic report on the interplay between knowledge acquisition, the perception of knowledge gaps, and the resulting self-stabilising effect on intrinsic motivation, with a specific focus on how this effect manifests across the different learning stages. The report should be testable, proposing or evaluating a theoretical model about how learning progress modulates perceived knowledge gaps and interest across different phases. The report should also discuss broader implementations of these dynamics in instructional design, feedback systems, or curiosity-driven learning environments.
