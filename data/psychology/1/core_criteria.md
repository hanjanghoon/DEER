1. Conceptual Clarity and Model Robustness
The report must define the self-stabilizing effect of knowledge acquisition precisely, explaining how perceived knowledge gaps generate intrinsic motivation. It must propose or evaluate a coherent theoretical or computational model (e.g., conceptual diagram, process model, or mathematical formalization) describing how knowledge accumulation influences curiosity across learning stages. The model must account for the non-linear relationship between knowledge, gap awareness, and motivational intensity.

2. Depth of Phase Analysis
The report must analyze in detail how the self-stabilizing effect evolves across Early, Intermediate, and Late learning phases. It must identify mechanistic explanations for why curiosity and persistence peak in the Intermediate phase and diminish later, incorporating cognitive and affective processes such as prediction error, perceived competence, and cognitive load. The report must cite evidence from prior empirical evidence to support or challenge the model.

3. Empirical or Theoretical Validation Framework
The paper must describe at least one rigorous way to test or validate the proposed model. This may involve a behavioral experiment, computational simulation, or secondary data analysis. For empirical proposals, the paper must clearly define measurable proxies for knowledge level (e.g., performance scores), perceived gaps (e.g., metacognitive awareness or prediction error), and intrinsic motivation (e.g., persistence, self-reported curiosity). For theoretical approaches, the validation plan should specify how model predictions could be compared with known empirical patterns.

4. Integration with Psychological and Motivational Theory
The paper must situate the self-stabilizing effect within broader frameworks of learning and motivation, such as curiosity theory, optimal incongruity, flow, and intrinsic motivation. It should discuss how this mechanism complements or extends established models (e.g., reward-learning frameworks, information-seeking models). Each connection should be conceptually justified with literature evidence.

5. Educational and Applied Implications
The paper must translate its theoretical insights into practical implications for instructional design, feedback mechanisms, or curiosity-based learning systems. Recommendations should explain how educators or designers can shape the learning environment (e.g., difficulty progression, feedback timing, challenge calibration) to induce or sustain the self-stabilizing effect in real learners.
