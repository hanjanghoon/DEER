Write an academic paper on self-powers modulo $m$, focusing on how the arithmetic structure of the modulus determines the distribution and periodicity of the residues $n^n \pmod m$. The study should use the specific case $m=22$ as a motivating example to illustrate how the interaction between different prime factors of $m$ influences the behavior of $S_m = \{n^n \pmod m \ : \ n \in \mathbb N\}$. In particular, the paper should:

-  Analyze the specific case of $m=22$
- Establish the theoretical framework of modular exponentiation, describing how the algebraic structure of the modulus and its residue system determines the periodicity and distribution of self-powers.
- Characterize the general behavior of $S_m$ for composite moduli, identifying its structural properties and conditions under which it covers the full residue system or exhibits restricted or repeating patterns.
- Discuss theoretical and computational implications, including possible generalizations for more moduli.
- Discuss possible directions for future research, including open questions about how the structure of $S_m$_​ evolves as $m$ varies.
