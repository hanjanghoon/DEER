Theoretical Framework and Periodicity
The paper must rigorously define all foundational concepts necessary for the study of self-powers modulo $m$: congruences and residue classes, Euler’s totient function $\varphi$, Carmichael’s function $\lambda$, multiplicative order modulo a prime power, and Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). These definitions must support a precise formulation and proof (or properly cited theorem) showing that $n^n \pmod m$ is periodic in $n$, with a period depending explicitly on $\lambda(m)$ or related structural invariants of the multiplicative group modulo $m$.

Structural and Local Analyses
The paper must analyze $n^n \pmod{p}$ for each prime power dividing $m$, identifying how base and exponent reductions interact with the multiplicative group structure. In the case $m=22$, the analysis must include the behavior of $n^n$ modulo 2 and 11, including multiplicative orders and exponent reduction modulo $\lambda(11)=10$. It must include a clear synthesis via CRT explaining how these local behaviors combine into a global result for $m=22$.

Global Result for m=22
The paper must compute explicitly $S_{22}$ and prove that all residues in the set are correct and distinct, and justify that no other residues occur. The argument must clearly connect back to the structural principles developed in previous sections (periodicity, local-to-global synthesis).

Generalization and Structural Insights
The paper must extend the reasoning beyond the specific case $m=22$, identifying general mechanisms by which the factorization of $m$ determines the structure of $S_m$.
It should discuss:
- How $S_m$ behaves for $m=p$ a prime number, $m=p^k$ a prime power, and arbitrary $m$.
- The role of $\lambda(m)$ and CRT in shaping periodicity and residue distribution.
- Possible classifications of $S_m$ (complete residue system, proper subsets, or periodic subsets)

Future Directions and Open Problems
The paper should conclude with a concise but meaningful discussion of possible extensions, such as:
- Asymptotic density or distribution questions for $S_m$ as $m \rightarrow \infty$.
- Connections to modular exponentiation patterns in number theory or cryptography.
- Theoretical questions on whether $S_m$ can be characterized by invariants of the multiplicative group modulo $m$.
