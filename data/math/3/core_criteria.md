Mathematical Structure of Infinite Products
The paper must provide a rigorous account of the mathematical structure of the infinite products $Q_0$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$. It should begin with precise formal definitions (including any $q$-Pochhammer or theta-function notation) and specify the domain assumptions for $q$ (e.g., $|q|<1$). The discussion should cover convergence criteria, explain how the products are well-defined, and analyze factor interactions such as symmetry between even and odd powers or alternating signs like $(1-q^{2n})$ versus $(1+q^{2n})$. The asymptotic behavior as $q \to 0$ and $q \to 1^-$ should be described to highlight simplifications in those regimes. The paper should relate each product to classical special-function frameworks such as Jacobi theta functions, $q$-series, or modular forms, and define all symbols explicitly to ensure consistency in later derivations.

Analytical Relationships Between the Products
The paper must explain the relationships among $Q_0$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, and $Q_3$ by focusing on structural symmetries and transformation techniques. The paper should show how even/odd shifts or sign alternations induce transformations between products and express these as functional relations when possible. It must use generating-function, modular, or Fourier-transform approaches to reveal interdependencies and discuss when Poisson summation or product-to-sum identities apply. It should also reference known results or identities from $q$-series and partition theory that reinforce these relationships.

Derivation of Closed-Form Expressions and Validity
Derivations should proceed in a clear, logically ordered manner, with each transformation step shown and each identity (such as Jacobi’s triple product) justified for convergence and domain. The paper must explicitly state the domain of validity for each expression, such as $|q|<1$, and mention any analytic continuation if used. The paper should ensure every assumption on $q$ is stated clearly and that convergence is verified at each major step.

Mathematical Consistency
The derivation must be conceptually sound and mathematically consistent throughout: every identity or transformation should be justified, and convergence should be checked at each major step. The paper must explicitly state the domain of validity for each closed form (for example, $|q|<1$) and declare any assumptions on the nature of $q$ (such as, $q\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|q|<1$). If analytic continuation is used, it should describe its scope and limitations and ensure the continued expressions remain consistent with the original convergence conditions. The paper must verify convergence and domain restrictions at every transformation step, and state clearly any assumptions about $q$ while noting where analytic continuation (if used) changes the domain of validity.
