Write an academic paper analyzing the closed-form expressions of infinite products, particularly focusing on the following infinite products:

$Q_0 = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 - q^{2n})$,
$Q_1 = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 + q^{2n})$,
$Q_2 = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 + q^{2n-1})$,
$Q_3 = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1 - q^{2n-1})$

The goal is to explore how mathematical identities, symmetries, and functional relationships between theta functions, infinite products, and related series lead to closed-form expressions for these products. The paper should focus on the theoretical framework surrounding infinite products and their derivation, without prescribing specific techniques.

The paper should address:
- The structure of infinite products and their relationships with special functions.
- How symmetries between the terms in the infinite products influence their simplification.
- The role of mathematical identities and advanced analytical frameworks in simplifying infinite products and deriving closed-form expressions, and how these techniques can extend to other types of infinite products or series without restricting the exploration to any single transformation or identity.
