1. Mathematical Structure of Point Orders

- Definition of “Order $k$”: The formal and precise definition of “order $k$” is emphasized, ensuring the analysis carefully distinguishes between a fixed point of iterates and a fixed point of the function itself. The comparison to periodic points, least periods, and prime periods is crucial for grounding this concept in established terminology.
- Properties of Order $k$: Detailed examination of the behavior of $f^k(x)$ is required, showing how points of order $k$ behave under iteration. This includes proving why $x$ cannot be a fixed point of $f$ and exploring the connections to periodic orbits of $f$. The characterization of the least period of $f$ must be mathematically robust.
- Framework Development: A coherent theoretical framework is needed to define the set of possible points that can or cannot have order $k$. This framework should incorporate assumptions about the function $f$ (e.g., continuity) and the behavior of its iterates. The relationship between the definitions $f^k(x) = x$ and $f(x) \neq x$ must be systematically explored.

2. Application of Sharkovsky’s Theorem

- Sharkovsky’s Theorem Overview: The paper must formally present Sharkovsky's Theorem and its relevance in the study of periodic points under iterated maps. The ordering of natural numbers in the theorem should be explored in relation to the concept of ""order $k$"" and its constraints.
- Implication Chains and Ordering: The paper must provide detailed reasoning about how Sharkovsky’s ordering impacts the possible values of $k$, particularly in the context of the assumptions (i.e., order 13 exists but order 11 does not), is required. This analysis should not simply state the exclusions but explore the reasoning behind why certain $k$-values are excluded based on Sharkovsky’s ordering.
- Detailed Reasoning from Sharkovsky’s Theorem: The paper must connect Sharkovsky’s ordering to the specific problem. It should trace how the existence of order 13 and the non-existence of order 11 lead to structural constraints on the set $S$. This is particularly important for understanding the cascading effect of exclusions between values.
- Relation to Known Results: The paper should ensure that the reasoning aligns with existing mathematical theorems, particularly those about periodicity, iterates, and fixed points. These references strengthen the paper’s credibility and connect the work to the broader research landscape.

3. Derivation Related to the Set $S$

- Set Definition: The set $S$ must be rigorously defined. Instead of simply listing the elements of $S$, the paper should focus on justifying the exclusions and inclusions of certain $k$-values based on Sharkovsky’s ordering and the definition of “order $k$.”
- Logical and Complete Argumentation: The paper must perform a step-by-step logical argument, which is necessary to justify why certain $k$-values are excluded from $S$ under the given assumptions. Each claimed inclusion or exclusion should be traceable to the definitions, assumptions, and ordering derived from Sharkovsky’s Theorem.
- Implication of “Order 13 Exists, Order 11 Does Not”: The coexistence of order 13 and the absence of order 11 is a key constraint. The paper must explore how this influences the set $S$, particularly focusing on how Sharkovsky’s theorem drives the exclusion or inclusion of other $k$-values in $S$.
- In-depth Structural Constraints: The analysis should explore the structural constraints imposed by Sharkovsky’s ordering, showing how certain $k$-values are eliminated systematically rather than arbitrarily. This part of the paper should provide a rigorous, mathematical justification for which orders are possible under the given assumptions.

4. Theoretical Implications and Structural Analysis

- Exclusion of Orders via Theorem: Instead of just listing excluded orders, the paper must delve into the reasoning behind the exclusions. After demonstrating the existence of order 13, the paper should explore why orders between 11 and 13 are automatically excluded, referencing the structural properties of Sharkovsky’s ordering.
- Structural Forces on $S$: The paper should explain how specific exclusions (like order 11) necessarily lead to the exclusion of other orders. This includes direct implications as well as indirect consequences of the ordering imposed by Sharkovsky’s Theorem.
- Interdependencies of $k$-values: The paper should highlight how the relationships between different $k$-values and their periodic orbits influence the possible existence of other orders. The cascading effect (where one exclusion forces others) must be explored in depth.

5. Clarity and Formality

- Mathematical Rigor: The paper must maintain a high level of mathematical rigor, ensuring all arguments are clearly stated and logically derived. The justification for the inclusion or exclusion of specific $k$-values should be mathematically sound and thoroughly explained.
- References and Citations: The paper must contain proper references to relevant mathematical literature (including works on periodic points, Sharkovsky’s Theorem, and related fixed-point theory). These references will strengthen the paper’s analysis and connect it to the wider body of mathematical research.
- Accessibility: While maintaining mathematical rigor, the paper should strive for accessibility, ensuring that advanced readers can follow the arguments. The explanation of concepts like Sharkovsky’s Theorem, point orders, and iterated maps should be clear and understandable.
