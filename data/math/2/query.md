Write a formal academic paper analyzing the concept of “order” for continuous functions on the real line, focusing on how fixed points of iterates shape the possible orders of points. Develop the theoretical framework for orders of points and explain how Sharkovsky’s Theorem (and its ordering) bears on these scenarios.
Emphasize the implications of these conditions: the existence of a point of order 13 and the non-existence of a point of order 11. The aim is to explore how Sharkovsky’s ordering constrains the set S = { k : there is no point of order k } without enumerating S or its cardinality.

The paper should address the following key aspects:
- Clarify the definition of “order k” used here (fixed by f^k but not by f) and relate it to standard terminology about periodic points and least period.
- Describe the role of Sharkovsky’s Theorem in constraining feasible orders under the stated assumptions.
- Discuss how the coexistence of “order 13 exists” and “order 11 does not exist” informs structural constraints on which orders may be forced or excluded, focusing on reasoning from the ordering rather than case-by-case enumeration.
