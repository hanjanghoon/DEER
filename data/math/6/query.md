Write a comprehensive academic paper on the topic of “Integral transformations and substitution techniques in calculus”. The paper should explore how these techniques can simplify complex integrals, with a specific focus on an expression involving integrals with nontrivial numerators and denominators. The goal is to analyze how different substitution strategies impact the complexity of such integrals and their solutions. 
Specifically, consider the expression:
$(12)^4 \cdot \left( \int_0^1 \frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{\left(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6\right)^{3/4}} \, dx - \int_0^1 \frac{x}{\left(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6\right)^{3/4}} \, dx \right)^4$

The paper should address the following:
- Substitution methods that simplify complex integrals, transforming both the bounds and the expressions within the integrals.
- The impact of substitutions on the structure of the integrals, focusing on how these transformations affect the powers of x in the numerator and denominator, facilitating simplification.
- Computational advantages and potential disadvantages of using substitution techniques, particularly with respect to the overall complexity of solving integrals, especially in numerical contexts.
- Generalization of the substitution methods discussed, considering their applicability to other types of integrals and their use in complex real-world problems, such as in physics, engineering, or other fields requiring similar integrals.
