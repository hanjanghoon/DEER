Write a professional academic paper on isomorphism classes of categories with only one object and a finite number of morphisms. This paper is intended to be a survey of the cases with a small number of morphisms and a starter for the study of larger numbers. The paper must include:
- All necessary definitions from Category Theory, such as the definition of category, the notion of isomorphism of categories, and the structure of categories with one single object. Moreover, the paper should situate the relevance of these concepts beyond the immediate purpose of the paper, e.g., their relation to algebraic structures.

- The relation between this problem and Monoid Theory. For this, all necessary definitions from Monoid Theory must be included. It must make precise how these notions emerge naturally from the categorical framework.

- The paper should determine and justify the number of isomorphism classes of categories with one object and a finite number of morphisms in the cases $n=1,2,3$. The analysis must be fully detailed, showing how the structural properties of these categories constrain the possibilities and lead to the final counts.

- An insight into how things would change for larger values of n. It should include the number of isomorphism classes for $n=4,5,6$ and compare how the number of isomorphism classes grows as $n$ grows.
