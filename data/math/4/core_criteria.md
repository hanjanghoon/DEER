Foundations & correspondence
The paper must contain precise definitions of categories, objects, morphisms, and identity morphisms, isomorphisms of categories, monoids and monoid homomorphisms.These definitions must be sufficient to rigorously state and prove the correspondence between categories with one object and monoids. For this, the paper must:
- State and prove (or cite a fully traceable reference for) the fact that every category with one object is determined, up to isomorphism, by a monoid up to isomorphism.
- Explain precisely how morphism composition corresponds to monoid multiplication.
- Justify why the problem of classifying categories with one object and $n$ morphisms reduces to classifying monoids with $n$ elements.
- Situate the category as a monoid correspondence within adjacent algebraic structures to clarify methodological relevance.

Small-n classification
The paper must enumerate the isomorphism classes of monoids of orders $1,2,3$; justify the completeness of this list by a logical or combinatorial argument (or by citing a reliable classification result); and describe the corresponding categories, making clear the correspondence between each monoid and its associated category.

Reported counts and growth for $n=4,5,6$
The report should specify the number of isomorphism classes of monoids for $n=4,5,6$ and include either a derivation or traceable scholarly references to standard enumeration results. The report should articulate how the count grows with $n$ and explain why classification rapidly becomes infeasible for larger $n$

Structural reasons for rapid growth
The paper must provide a concise discussion of why the number of isomorphism classes grows quickly as $n$ increases, explaining how this difficulty is related to the structure of monoid multiplication tables and associativity constraints, and indicating possible strategies or references for tackling larger $n$.
