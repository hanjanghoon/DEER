Foundations and problem statement
The paper must clearly and rigorously define fixed points, Lipschitz maps and Lipschitz constants, and strictly distance-decreasing maps (functions $f$ with $|f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y|$ for all $x != y$)

Core one-dimensional result
The paper must illustrate a correct existence proof for f: R -> R (e.g., via $g(x) = f(x) - x$ and the Intermediate Value Theorem) and demonstrate uniqueness by applying the strict Lipschitz inequality to hypothetical distinct fixed points to derive a contradiction.

Relation to Banach’s theorem
The paper must state Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem, clearly identify differences and similarities in hypotheses relative to the setting here, and justify why uniqueness is preserved under the strict inequality even without a uniform contraction constant c < 1. The report should specify at least one example or counterexample showing the necessity of strict inequality.

Generalized settings
The paper must formulate and justify uniqueness for strictly distance-decreasing self-maps on general metric spaces, and distinguish which existence claims require additional hypotheses (e.g., compactness or completeness). The report should include at least one example or counterexample illustrating behavior in a generalized setting. 

Non-strict inequality
The paper must illustrate what happens when |f(x) - f(y)| < |x - y| is replaced by |f(x) - f(y)| <= |x - y|, and show that uniqueness may fail via a correct counterexample.
