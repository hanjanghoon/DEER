Write an academic paper on fixed points for strictly distance-decreasing mappings and related problems. The paper should study the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for continuous functions on R satisfying a strict Lipschitz-type inequality, and to explore extensions to more general settings. The paper should: 
- Define key concepts (fixed points, Lipschitz maps, Lipschitz constants, strictly distance-decreasing maps) 
- Examine the existence and uniqueness of fixed points for such maps on ℝ 
- Connections and contrasts with the classical Banach Fixed-Point Theorem
-Extend to more general metric spaces, identifying conditions under which existence or uniqueness holds
- Explore how results change when the strict inequality is replaced by a non-strict one.
All claims must be supported by rigorous proofs or authoritative references.
