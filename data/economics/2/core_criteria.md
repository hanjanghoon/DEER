The paper must clearly define the TSLS setup with one endogenous regressor and one instrument, presenting all equations (structural and reduced forms) and notation consistently. It must specify the assumptions of exogeneity, homoscedasticity, and asymptotic framework under which Nagar approximations apply.

Analytical Derivation of Relative Bias. The derivation linking the TSLS bias to first-stage strength must be complete and mathematically consistent. The paper must derive the relative asymptotic bias (ratio of TSLS bias to OLS bias) using Nagar or equivalent approximations and express it explicitly in terms of the F-statistic and sample size scaling.

Establishing the 10% Bias Criterion and Confidence Level. The paper must formally define the condition “relative asymptotic bias < 10% with 95% confidence,” interpret it probabilistically, and solve for the implied F-statistic cutoff. The approach should clarify whether the bias criterion is based on expected value, distribution quantiles, or simulation confidence bounds.

Critical Evaluation of Conventional Rules. The discussion must critically contrast the derived threshold with the conventional F ≥ 10 rule. It should explain why Stock & Yogo (2005) results are not directly applicable for the one-instrument case and delineate the conceptual difference between size distortion and relative bias control.

Homoscedastic vs. Heteroscedastic Considerations. The paper must discuss how the bias expression and cutoff may change if homoscedasticity is relaxed. It should briefly describe potential extensions under heteroscedastic errors or conditional heterogeneity and their implications for instrument validity.

Numerical or Simulation Verification. The analysis must include at least one empirical or simulated illustration showing the mapping between first-stage F-statistics and relative bias. Results must show how the 95% confidence region for <10% bias is achieved and must verify the analytical approximation numerically.

Interpretation and Implications. The conclusion must synthesize theoretical and numerical insights, clearly stating the empirical implications for applied researchers—especially the risk of bias under low F-statistics—and the proper interpretation of instrument strength diagnostics.

Clarity and Theoretical Consistency. All formulas, parameters, and terms (e.g., asymptotic bias, Nagar approximation, F-statistic definition) must be defined consistently across sections. The mathematical reasoning must be internally coherent and empirically interpretable within standard econometric frameworks.
