"Write an academic paper analyzing the relationship between instrument strength and asymptotic bias in two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimation under a single-instrument, single-endogenous-variable setting.
The paper should focus on quantifying the minimum first-stage F-statistic required to ensure that the relative asymptotic bias of the TSLS estimator is less than 10% with 95% confidence, under the assumption of homoscedasticity.
The analysis should:
- Derive the analytical relationship between first-stage strength (F-statistic) and the relative asymptotic bias of TSLS
- Discuss the statistical interpretation of the “10% relative bias” criterion, clarifying how it differs from size distortion or weak instrument thresholds 
- Critically evaluate the validity of the conventional rule of thumb (F ≥ 10) in the one-instrument case, referencing theoretical and simulation-based evidence.
- Compare asymptotic bias behavior under homoscedastic versus heteroscedastic designs, and discuss the implications for empirical practice and policy inference.
- Include a numerical or simulation-based demonstration showing how relative bias evolves as F-statistics vary, highlighting the cutoff ensuring 95% confidence for <10% bias."
