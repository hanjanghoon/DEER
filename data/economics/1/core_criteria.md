Formal Model Definition and Setup: The paper should clearly define all variables ($q_i$, $Q$, $P$) and parameters, including the capacity limit and the discontinuous marginal cost condition. It should derive the aggregate market demand $Q = \sum_i q_i$ explicitly and compute the corresponding inverse demand curve $P(Q)$. The paper must demonstrate and explain how the interdependence between individual and total demand ($q_i(Q, P)$) affects the shape of the demand curve and market behavior.
    
Profit Maximization and Equilibrium Derivation: The paper should formulate the profit function $\pi(Q) = P(Q) \cdot Q$ with the constraint that production cannot exceed 10 units. It should correctly derive the equilibrium price and total quantity through first-order conditions and boundary analysis. It should also compute and interpret the resulting excess demand $Q_d - Q_s$ at equilibrium, demonstrating the steps clearly. The analysis must be mathematically consistent and all derivatives and substitutions justified.
    
Characterization and Interpretation of Excess Demand: The paper must provide an analytical and intuitive explanation of how excess demand arises from the capacity constraint. The paper should discuss whether the market-clearing condition holds or whether rationing, waiting, or priority allocation mechanisms emerge. It must situate the result within economic theory (e.g., rationing equilibria, constrained supply markets, monopoly with quantity limits).
    
Comparative Statics and Sensitivity Analysis: The paper should conduct comparative statics on at least two parameters (e.g., number of consumers, cost cutoff, or functional form of $Q$). The paper should demonstrate how changes in these parameters shift equilibrium outcomes and alter the magnitude of excess demand. It should present results in analytical or tabular form, and interpret them in terms of economic behavior and welfare.
    
Link to Broader Economic Context and Theory: The paper must connect the model to real-world examples of capacity-constrained markets (e.g., electricity, telecom bandwidth, transportation, or concert tickets). It should discuss how such cases illustrate or deviate from the theoretical predictions. Additionally, the paper should relate the findings to broader theoretical frameworks, such as monopoly pricing under constraints, rationing equilibria, or welfare implications of non-clearing markets.
    
Internal Consistency and Logical Coherence: The paper should maintain consistent notation throughout the paper. Ensure that all derived results should align with economic intuition (e.g., price increases with scarcity). If a numerical example (such as $P = 20$, $Q = 40$, excess demand $= 30$) is included, it should verify that it follows logically from the derived equations and definitions. The argumentation must be self-contained, with every conclusion traceable to a formally derived result.
