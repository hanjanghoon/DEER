Write a structured expert linguistic report that diagnoses the specific source of ungrammaticality in a set of candidate sentences. The primary objective is to identify and justify ungrammatical sentences due to a violation of Binding Theory (Principles A, B, or C), and to conclusively distinguish this violation from potential ungrammaticalities caused by island constraints on movement or other syntactic violations.
The report should consider the following specific cases: 
- Who likes Mary and Jane? She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.
- John likes Mary's glasses. Whose does John like glasses?
- John likes Mary and himself. Who does John like Mary and?

The report must provide a full theoretical justification for any identified ungrammatical cases, using rigorous syntactic analysis grounded in Chomsky's Government & Binding Theory or the Minimalist Program. The study must clarify how Binding Theory and movement constraints impose distinct, module-specific locality conditions on syntactic well-formedness.
