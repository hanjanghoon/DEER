The report must identify any sentence showing ungrammaticality related to dependency within a local binding domain (rather than one involving long-distance movement) and provide explicit structural reasoning for that determination, using diagrams or detailed constituent analysis where appropriate. It should describe the type of dependency each example involves (e.g., binding, co-reference, or movement) and explain whether ungrammaticality arises from a locality violation or a cross-clause dependency. It should also discuss how the pattern of (un)acceptability across these sentences can be accounted for by general principles of syntactic theory, without assuming any specific terminology in advance.

Analysis and Discussion
The report must compare the internal structure of each sentence: determine binding domains, identify antecedent–anaphor relations, and note any movement restrictions. It should explain how violations of Principles A, B, or C manifest structurally and how they differ from island-induced unacceptability. Additionally, it should discuss why certain sentences that appear ungrammatical may instead be ruled out by island constraints or other syntactic constraints rather than by binding. Where helpful, the report should include minimal contrasts (e.g., altering pronoun/anaphor choice or clause type) to sharpen the diagnosis.

Completeness of Required Content
· Binding Theory coverage: The report must provide formal definitions of Principles A/B/C; state and justify the local domain choice (e.g., TP/CP/DP domain assumptions), define c-command, and fix coindexation conventions that are used consistently throughout.
· Island coverage: The report must precisely state CNPC, Wh-Island, Subject Island, Adjunct Island, and CSC; for each island sentence, the report must identify the exact extraction site and barrier and show why intermediate steps (e.g., to phase edges) fail.
· Per-sentence structural analysis: The report must provide a structural representation (tree/brackets) for every provided sentence, including binding domain computation and/or movement path annotation.

Specificity and Evaluability
· Notation policy: The report must fix notation for indices (i, j), traces/copies, features ([wh], [φ], [anaphor], etc.), phase heads (v, C), and locality domains, and use the same system in all sections.
· Binding diagnostics: The report must show precisely why an anaphor/pronoun/R-expression satisfies or violates its principle (e.g., himself not locally bound; he c-commanding John with coindexation ⇒ Principle C).
· Island diagnostics: The report must identify the illicit dependency step (e.g., extraction from a subject CP/DP; crossing an embedded [wh] Spec,CP) and connect it to the named constraint; if suggesting an alternative derivation, the report must show where it still crashes.
· Confound control: Where a sentence could conceivably have both a binding and a movement issue, the report must argue which one is structurally decisive for ungrammaticality in the grammar being assumed.

Expert-Level Detail
·       The report must include stepwise derivations or proof-like arguments: compute binding domains and derive movement paths under PIC; state which intermediate positions are (un)available.
·       When appealing to external results (e.g., standard definitions of PIC), the report must restate the assumptions and consequences used so that the application is traceable within the report.
·       The report should present at least one constructive minimal pair (e.g., replace himself with him or alter clause structure) to demonstrate that the reported violation tracks the intended property (binding vs. island).

Flexibility Where Multiple Valid Approaches Exist
The analyses must be framed in GB, Minimalist terms, or both and it must keep notation consistent across sections. The report should explain the correspondence of locality conditions (e.g., binding domain vs. phase-bounded movement), and ensure that whichever framework is chosen, the same empirical conclusions follow for the dataset.
