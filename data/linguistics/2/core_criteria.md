Terminology & translation conventions
The paper must adhere to the stated conventions: render batzi/bats’i k’op as “Tzotzil/Tsotsil”; no added 1st-person possession on the language NP; j- marks the only 1sg possession in jna.

Morphosyntactic identification & glossing
The paper must exhibit correct segmentation and Leipzig-style glossing that explicitly identifies oy (existential), ox (past/future), k’op (word/talk/language), batzi/bats’i k’op (autonym), j- (1sg possessive) in jna, ta (locative/oblique), and junabi (last year). The analysis must accurately categorize each item (particle, possessive prefix, relational/prepositional marker, temporal adverb) with distributional evidence.

Temporal/aspectual analysis
The paper must provide a precise account of existence and temporal reference via particles, affixes, and word order; the affirmative existential predicate oy ‘be/exist’ and its distribution in declaratives; the temporal particle ox (past/future uses) and its interaction with temporal adverbs such as junabi ‘last year’; how existential, temporal (ox, adverbials), and aspectual cues jointly locate eventualities.

Possession & alignment
The paper must demonstrate Set A possession (with j- as 1sg) and its relation to ergative alignment, including a correct analysis of ta jna ‘at my house’ (jna < j- + na ‘house’)  as a locative PP hosting a possessed NP.

Lexical semantics & autonymy
The paper must give a rigorous treatment of k’op polysemy and the status of batzi/bats’i k’op as the autonym for Tzotzil, showing how these NPs participate in existential/locative clauses and encode language identity.

Syntactic integration & information structure
The paper must illustrate how existential, locative, temporal, and possessive components combine in clause structure (using the target sentence), including word-order tendencies, topic–comment organization, and the role of ta in oblique marking; effects of definiteness/deixis and information structure must be made explicit.

Comparative Mayan context
Comparative claims must be tied to Tzeltal and Chol, explicitly addressing tense–aspect particles (including ox), ergativity, and possession systems; the analysis must clarify which features are shared vs. divergent and note dialect-internal variation in Tzotzil where relevant.

Translation justification
The report should specify an English translation for the target sentence supported by the identified morphemes and clause structure, with explicit reasoning grounded in morphosyntax/pragmatics and culturally aware treatment of batzi/bats’i k’op and jna.

Methodological soundness
The methodology must employ distributional tests, minimal pairs/contrasts, interlinear glossing, and field-linguistic argumentation to substantiate claims, with citations to relevant descriptive sources.
