Write a professional academic report on how morphosyntactic structure, syntactic complexity, temporal reference (past vs. present), spatial and possessive relations are encoded in Tzotzil (San Lorenzo Zinacantán dialect; Chiapas, Mexico). Use the particular clause: ‘Oy ox k’op ta batzi/bats’i k’op ta jna junabi and derive its English translation within a theoretical discussion of Tzotzil grammar. The analysis should account for how existence, temporality, and possession interact to form well-structured clauses in this language, focusing on the interplay between morphology and syntax.
