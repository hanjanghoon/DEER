# Morphosyntax, Temporality, and Possession in Tzotzil (San Lorenzo Zinacantán):

## An Analysis Centered on the Clause *Oy ox k’op ta bats’i k’op ta jna junabi*

---

## Abstract

This report presents a detailed morphosyntactic and semantic analysis of how existence, syntactic complexity, temporal reference, spatial relations, and possession are encoded in Tzotzil, a Mayan language spoken in Chiapas, Mexico, with particular attention to the San Lorenzo Zinacantán dialect. Using the naturally occurring clause *Oy ox k’op ta bats’i k’op ta jna junabi* as a focal case study, the paper derives its English translation and situates it within broader theoretical discussions of Tzotzil grammar. The analysis demonstrates that Tzotzil encodes existence through non-verbal existential predicates, temporality through aspectual and pragmatic means rather than tense morphology, and possession through locative and relational constructions. The clause illustrates how morphosyntactic structure integrates existential predication (*oy*), numeral quantification (*ox*), nominal classification (*k’op*), spatial/relational marking (*ta*), and possessive anchoring (*jna*), yielding a well-formed clause whose interpretation depends on the interaction of morphology, syntax, and discourse context. The report situates these findings within the typological profile of Mayan languages and contributes to understanding how grammatical relations emerge from the interplay of spatial, existential, and possessive structures.

# 1. Introduction

Tzotzil is a Mayan language spoken by approximately 400,000 speakers in the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, with significant dialectal variation across communities such as Zinacantán, Chamula, and Chenalhó [1]. As a member of the Mayan family, Tzotzil exhibits characteristic features such as ergative-absolutive alignment, rich aspectual systems, limited tense morphology, and extensive use of relational nouns to encode spatial and possessive relations [2].

This report examines how morphosyntactic structure, syntactic complexity, temporal reference (particularly the contrast between past and present), and spatial and possessive relations are encoded in Tzotzil, focusing on the San Lorenzo Zinacantán dialect. The discussion centers on the clause:

> **Oy ox k’op ta bats’i k’op ta jna junabi**

This clause is particularly well-suited for analysis because it combines existential predication, numeral quantification, metalinguistic reference (*bats’i k’op* ‘true/real Tzotzil language’), spatial-relational marking, and possessive anchoring to a first-person domain. By unpacking the grammatical structure of this clause, the paper illustrates how Tzotzil integrates morphology and syntax to express existence, temporality, and possession without relying on tense-marked verbal predicates.

The goals of the report are threefold. First, it provides a theoretically grounded morphosyntactic analysis of the clause and derives a justified English translation. Second, it situates the clause within broader patterns of Tzotzil grammar, including existential constructions, aspectual-temporal reference, and possessive relations. Third, it highlights how these grammatical domains interact to form well-structured clauses in Tzotzil, contributing to typological and theoretical discussions of language structure.

# 2. Linguistic Background: Tzotzil and the Zinacantán Dialect

## 2.1 Genetic and Typological Profile

Tzotzil belongs to the Tzeltalan branch of the Mayan language family, closely related to Tzeltal [1]. Like other Mayan languages, it is primarily verb-initial (VOS/VSO), exhibits ergative-absolutive alignment in its verbal morphology, and relies heavily on aspect rather than tense to encode temporal relations [2].

A defining typological feature of Tzotzil is the prominence of non-verbal predicates, including existential, locative, and possessive constructions. These constructions often lack an overt copula and instead rely on specialized predicates such as *oy* ‘exist/be present’ or relational nouns combined with prepositions [3].

## 2.2 The San Lorenzo Zinacantán Dialect

The dialect of San Lorenzo Zinacantán has been extensively documented in descriptive and ethnographic work, notably by Laughlin and Haviland [4]. This dialect is often considered conservative in its retention of traditional morphosyntactic structures, while also exhibiting pragmatic and lexical features tied to local cultural practices.

In Zinacantán Tzotzil, the expression *bats’i k’op* (‘true language’) is a culturally salient term used to refer to authentic or traditional Tzotzil speech, contrasting with Spanish or mixed codes [5]. This sociolinguistic dimension is relevant for interpreting the clause under analysis, as it embeds metalinguistic content within an existential-possessive structure.

# 3. Morphosyntactic Foundations of Tzotzil Clauses

## 3.1 Word Order and Predicate Types

Canonical Tzotzil clauses are verb-initial when a verbal predicate is present. However, non-verbal predicates—including existential, adjectival, and nominal predicates—are equally central to the grammar [2]. These predicates typically appear clause-initially and may take nominal complements without copular morphology.

Existential predicates such as *oy* function syntactically as heads of predicate phrases, selecting nominal or clausal complements. Unlike verbs, they do not inflect for person or number, and their temporal interpretation is derived from aspectual particles or discourse context [3].

## 3.2 Nominal Structure and Classifiers

Nouns in Tzotzil may be preceded by numerals, which often require numeral classifiers depending on the semantic class of the noun [6]. However, abstract nouns such as *k’op* ‘word, speech, language’ frequently appear without overt classifiers, especially in metalinguistic contexts.

Possessive relations are encoded through possessive prefixes on relational nouns or possessed nouns, with first-person singular typically marked by *j-* [2]. This morphology plays a key role in anchoring referents to discourse participants.

---

# 4. Existential Predication in Tzotzil

## 4.1 The Predicate *oy*

The existential predicate *oy* expresses existence, presence, or availability. It can often be translated as ‘there is/are’ or ‘exist’ in English, but its semantic scope is broader, encompassing states of being, presence in a location, or inclusion within a domain [3].

Crucially, *oy* does not encode tense. A clause headed by *oy* may be interpreted as present, past, or even habitual depending on contextual cues, aspectual particles, or temporal adverbs. This absence of tense morphology underscores the importance of pragmatic inference in Tzotzil temporal interpretation [7].

## 4.2 Existential vs. Possessive Readings

In many Mayan languages, existential constructions overlap with possessive constructions. A structure equivalent to ‘there is X at Y’ often yields a possessive interpretation ‘Y has X’ [8]. In Tzotzil, this is achieved through locative marking with *ta* combined with a possessed relational noun or location.

The clause under analysis exemplifies this pattern: the existential *oy* introduces an entity whose existence is anchored to a possessive-spatial domain (*ta jna* ‘at my house’), yielding a meaning equivalent to ‘I have…’ in English.

---

# 5. Spatial and Possessive Relations

## 5.1 The Preposition *ta*

The preposition *ta* is multifunctional, marking spatial location, direction, and more abstract relations such as possession or inclusion [2]. When combined with a possessed noun like *jna* (‘my house’), *ta* encodes a locative domain that can be reinterpreted possessively.

## 5.2 Relational Nouns and Possession

Possession in Tzotzil is frequently expressed through relational nouns rather than a verb ‘have’. The noun *na* ‘house’ with the possessive prefix *j-* (‘my’) yields *jna* ‘my house’. When used in a locative phrase (*ta jna*), it establishes a domain associated with the speaker.

This structure allows existential clauses to express possession indirectly, aligning with cross-linguistic patterns in Mayan and other Mesoamerican languages [8].

# 6. Temporal Reference Without Tense

## 6.1 Aspect and Pragmatic Temporality

Tzotzil lacks grammatical tense in the Indo-European sense. Instead, it employs aspectual markers (e.g., completive, incompletive, potential) primarily on verbal predicates [2]. In non-verbal existential clauses, temporal reference is inferred pragmatically.

In the absence of overt aspectual marking, *oy* is typically interpreted as present or current existence. Past or future readings require additional temporal adverbs or contextual anchoring.

## 6.2 Implications for the Clause Under Study

The clause *Oy ox k’op ta bats’i k’op ta jna junabi* lacks explicit temporal adverbs or aspectual particles. As a result, its default interpretation is present or stative: it asserts the existence of a certain quantity of ‘true Tzotzil words’ within the speaker’s domain at the time of utterance.

---

# 7. Detailed Clause Analysis

## 7.1 Morphological Breakdown

The clause can be segmented as follows:

* **Oy** – existential predicate ‘exist/there is’
* **ox** – numeral ‘three’
* **k’op** – noun ‘word, speech, language’
* **ta** – preposition ‘at/in’
* **bats’i k’op** – ‘true/real language (Tzotzil)’
* **ta** – preposition ‘at/in’
* **jna** – ‘my house’ (*j-* ‘my’ + *na* ‘house’)
* **junabi** – adverbial element often glossed as ‘still, yet, already’ or ‘nowadays’, depending on context [4]

## 7.2 Syntactic Structure

Syntactically, the clause consists of an existential predicate (*oy*) taking a quantified nominal phrase (*ox k’op*) as its primary argument. This nominal is further specified by a locative-modifying phrase (*ta bats’i k’op*), indicating the domain or type of language to which the words belong. A second locative phrase (*ta jna*) anchors the existential claim to the speaker’s possessive domain.

The adverbial *junabi* contributes discourse-level temporal or aspectual nuance, reinforcing the present relevance of the existential claim.

## 7.3 Semantic Composition

Semantically, the clause asserts the existence of three linguistic items (*ox k’op*) characterized as belonging to authentic Tzotzil (*bats’i k’op*) within the speaker’s domain (*ta jna*). The construction thus integrates existential, classificatory, spatial, and possessive semantics.

---

# 8. Deriving the English Translation

A justified English translation of the clause is:

> **“There are three genuine Tzotzil words in my house (still/nowadays).”**

Alternatively, adopting a possessive paraphrase more natural in English:

> **“I still have three genuine Tzotzil words at home.”**

The choice between these translations reflects differences between Tzotzil and English in encoding possession. While Tzotzil uses an existential-locative structure, English typically employs a possessive verb (*have*). Both translations are semantically faithful, but the former more closely mirrors the source structure.

---

# 9. Syntactic Complexity and Clause Integration

Although superficially simple, the clause exhibits notable syntactic complexity. It integrates multiple layers of modification—quantification, classification, and locative anchoring—within a single existential structure. This complexity arises not from embedding or subordination, but from the accumulation of relational morphology and syntax.

Such structures illustrate how Tzotzil achieves expressive richness without extensive inflectional morphology, relying instead on the interaction of predicates, prepositions, and nominal modifiers [6].

---

# 10. Broader Theoretical Implications

## 10.1 Morphology–Syntax Interface

The clause demonstrates a tight interface between morphology and syntax. Possessive prefixes, relational nouns, and prepositions jointly determine argument structure and interpretation. This supports theoretical approaches that view grammatical relations as emergent from constructions rather than fixed syntactic positions [9].

## 10.2 Typological Significance

From a typological perspective, the clause exemplifies how languages without tense-marked copulas or ‘have’-verbs encode existence and possession through spatial metaphors. This aligns Tzotzil with broader patterns observed in Mayan and other indigenous American languages [8].

---

# 11. Conclusion

The analysis of *Oy ox k’op ta bats’i k’op ta jna junabi* reveals how Tzotzil encodes existence, temporality, and possession through the interaction of morphosyntactic elements rather than through tense or copular verbs. The clause illustrates a grammatical system in which existential predicates, spatial relations, and possessive morphology converge to form well-structured and semantically rich clauses.

By situating this clause within the broader grammatical system of the San Lorenzo Zinacantán dialect, the report highlights the centrality of non-verbal predication and relational morphology in Tzotzil. These findings contribute to ongoing discussions in linguistic theory regarding the nature of grammatical relations, the role of space in encoding possession, and the diversity of temporal reference systems across languages.
