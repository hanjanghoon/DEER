Write an academic paper examining the interpretation of Rawls’ concept of reciprocity in contexts of socioeconomic inequality, particularly among citizens experiencing poverty. The paper should analyze whether Rawls’ concept of reciprocity can be applied in societies marked by structural inequality and economic deprivation. The study should evaluate whether moral and civic obligations remain binding when material circumstances prevent equal capacity to reciprocate, and whether Rawls’ framework sufficiently accounts for such asymmetries. The paper should engage critically with A Theory of Justice and related literature, exploring whether reciprocity presupposes socioeconomic fairness or can coexist with enduring poverty.
