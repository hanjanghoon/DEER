"1. Theoretical Context and Problem Definition
The paper must clearly define Arrhenius’s Sixth Impossibility Theorem, including the full set of conditions (e.g., Egalitarian Dominance, Non-Elitism, General Non-Extreme Priority, Weak Quality Addition, and Weak Non-Sadism). It must explain how these collectively express intuitions about moral permissibility and trade-offs in population ethics. The paper should then define critical-level utilitarianism and show how its value function—subtracting a fixed critical welfare constant from each life—structurally alters population comparisons.

2. Formal and Conceptual Analysis of the Violation
The paper must provide a step-by-step demonstration of how critical-level views violate Weak Non-Sadism. This includes:
- Representing the critical-level aggregation rule mathematically
- Showing that adding enough lives with welfare just above the critical level produces a negative change in total value
- Explicitly contrasting this with the Weak Non-Sadism requirement that adding positive lives should never make a population worse.
The reasoning must be logically valid and formally clear, showing that the violation is not contingent on specific parameter choices but inherent to the view.

3. Philosophical Interpretation of Weak Non-Sadism
The paper must explain the normative intuition behind Weak Non-Sadism (lives worth living cannot make an outcome worse) and assess whether this intuition is defensible. The paper should discuss whether rejecting Weak Non-Sadism undermines ethical plausibility or merely challenges conventional welfare assumptions. It should examine how this principle relates to broader anti-sadistic commitments in axiology and moral theory.

4. Comparative Evaluation of Population Axiologies
The paper must compare critical-level views with alternative population theories, such as total utilitarianism, average utilitarianism, and critical-range theories, and show how each treats the addition of low-welfare lives differently. It should assess whether these alternatives satisfy Weak Non-Sadism and identify what theoretical costs they incur instead. The comparison must clarify whether the violation of Weak Non-Sadism is unique to fixed critical-level views or shared with nearby formulations.

5. Implications for Theoretical Coherence and Moral Intuition
The paper must evaluate whether violating Weak Non-Sadism renders critical-level views untenable or merely reformulates the value structure of welfare aggregation. It should connect the result to broader debates about the Repugnant Conclusion, the Sadistic Conclusion, and axiological neutrality. The conclusion should assess whether this violation reveals an internal inconsistency, a redefinition of moral value, or a deliberate sacrifice of one moral intuition to preserve others. It must situate the analysis within the ongoing theoretical project of reconciling impossibility theorems in population ethics, outlining how this insight might inform future attempts at constructing consistent population principles."
