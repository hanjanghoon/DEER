Write a philosophical research paper analyzing how critical-level views in population ethics violate the Weak Non-Sadism condition of Arrhenius’s Sixth Impossibility Theorem. The paper should explore the logical structure of the theorem, explain why introducing a positive critical level leads to violations of non-sadism, and assess whether this conflict reveals a deeper inconsistency in critical-level axiology or an acceptable trade-off within population ethics. The paper should evaluate whether the violation is a result of the definition of value aggregation itself or of deeper commitments about how we treat lives barely worth living.
