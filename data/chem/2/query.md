Write a professional analytical report on the use of ¹³C NMR spectroscopy for the structural elucidation of alkenes with molecular formula C₇H₁₄. The report should explain how chemical-shift patterns, carbon multiplicities (s, d, t, q), and signal overlaps reveal information about branching, double-bond substitution, and molecular symmetry.

Use the spectral dataset 145 (s), 112 (t), 48 (t), 27 (d), 22 (q), 21 (q) as an applied example to demonstrate the full reasoning process from raw NMR data to final structural identification.

The report must integrate theoretical principles of ¹³C NMR spectroscopy with a clear, stepwise analytical framework leading to a unique, data-consistent structural assignment, and conclude with brief commentary on how complementary techniques can resolve potential ambiguities caused by overlapping signals.

The paper must include:

- The theoretical relationship between 13C chemical shifts and the hybridization/electronic environment of carbons (sp2 vs. sp3).
- The role of multiplicity information (DEPT or related methods) in distinguishing CH, CH2, CH3, and quaternary carbons in hydrocarbon frameworks.
- Analysis of how equivalent carbons in symmetric or branched structures cause overlapping signals, reducing the apparent number of unique resonances.
- A structured framework for deducing fragment connectivity from NMR data, integrating both shift values and multiplicity.
- An applied example using the dataset 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q) that traces reasoning from spectral data to a full structure identification.
- A structural assignment consistent with the spectral pattern and molecular constraints, with brief notes on resolving ambiguity due to overlapping signals using complementary spectroscopic techniques.
