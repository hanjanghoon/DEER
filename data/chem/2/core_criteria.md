Theoretical Basis of 13C NMR Spectroscopy
The report must articulate the principles linking 13C chemical shifts to carbon hybridization and electronic environment, specifying expected shift ranges for olefinic, aliphatic, and quaternary carbons. It must state why signals near ~145 ppm and ~112 ppm correspond to sp2 carbons and how these establish the presence of a C=C bond.

Multiplicity and Carbon-Type Identification
The report must identify how s/d/t/q (via DEPT or equivalent) map to CH, CH2, CH3, and quaternary carbons and apply this to the dataset. Each signal—145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)—must be classified with justification, consistent with alkene environments.

Signal Overlap and Symmetry
The paper must recognize that fewer than seven unique 13C signals are observed and explain the structural reason. It must show how chemical equivalence or symmetry produces overlapping signals (for example, equivalent methyl groups), and how this impacts interpretation.

Fragment Deduction and Connectivity Reasoning
The paper must present a structured, stepwise deduction of fragments (olefinic, methylene, methine, methyl) justified by shift and multiplicity, and combine them into a consistent skeleton while ruling out inconsistent arrangements with data-based arguments.

Structural Assembly and Validation
The report must integrate all fragments into a complete structure satisfying C7H14 and the 13C data, verify hydrogen balance, and reconcile expected versus observed signal count (explaining overlap where necessary).

Complementary Techniques
The paper must include a concise discussion of how additional NMR experiments would confirm fragment connectivity or resolve overlap-related ambiguities.

Analytical Depth and Chemical Plausibility
The paper must interpret how branching, substitution, and hybridization influence observed shifts/multiplicity, noting deshielding trends, hyperconjugation, and inductive effects where applicable; the proposed structure must be chemically reasonable for a C7 alkene.

Verification of Final Structural Outcome
The conclusion must show that no alternative arrangement fits the data equally well and that the unique structure consistent with all constraints corresponds to 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene, without stating this outcome prematurely in the main analysis.
