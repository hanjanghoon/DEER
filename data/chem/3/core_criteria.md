Photochemical Principles and Mechanistic Accuracy
The brief must accurately state azobenzene E/Z isomerization about N=N, distinguish rotation vs. inversion, identify spectral triggers (UV for trans→cis; visible/thermal for cis→trans), indicate representative quantum yields and thermal back-isomerization timescales under ambient conditions, and tie this molecular switching to its intended macroscopic analogue.

Solar-Spectrum Mapping and Trigger Logic
The report must analyze daily variation of the local solar spectrum and map wavelength regions to the light-induced transitions; it must address sunrise/midday/sunset differences, latitude/season/weather variability, and justify whether passive sunlight suffices or if spectral filtering or auxiliary LEDs are required.

Geometric Translation and Kinematic Design
The report must define two distinct, stable geometries corresponding to trans (elongated, approximately planar) and cis (bent, compact), and specify a linkage/hinge scheme that mimics rotation (or inversion) about the N=N axis; it must include quantitative targets (angular displacement, stroke, tolerances) that convey the molecular analogy at human scale.

Actuation Mechanism and Control System
The paper must present a technically feasible actuation approach (photoresponsive materials or sensor-driven motorized linkages) with justification on responsiveness, energy, and reliability; it must include control logic for sunrise/sunset thresholds and anti-chatter hysteresis/delays, with a clear logic description.

Material Selection, Safety, and Durability
The report must specify outdoor-rated materials (UV stability, fatigue resistance, corrosion protection, load capacity); address safety (pinch-point mitigation, structural integrity for seating use, weatherproofing); and include maintenance/inspection intervals and replacement procedures for photoresponsive components or sensors.

Validation Protocol and Performance Metrics
The paper must propose quantitative success criteria (e.g., repeatable daily cycles over a defined lifetime, defined angle change, < specified transition time, acceptable energy use, safety compliance), describe data-collection methods (spectral monitoring, displacement sensing, cycle counts), and outline testing (cycle testing, environmental exposure, daylight benchmarking).

Integration of Photochemistry and Engineering Design
The report must explicitly connect the microscopic model to the macroscopic mechanism, showing one-to-one correspondence between N=N torsion and table motion, and demonstrate that the final design visibly embodies reversible cis–trans switching.

Design Documentation and Professional Structure
The document must use the specified section order (see G) and include quantitative parameters or actionable specifications in each section; tone must remain neutral and technical. (Drawings/tables/schematics are optional but, if present, must support evaluation.)

Fidelity to Azobenzene Functionality
The paper must make clear that shape change is light-driven and reversible specifically about the N=N analog, with elongation/bending that maps to trans/cis geometry and reversibility consistent with the photothermal cycle.
