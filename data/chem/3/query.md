Write a technical design brief for a solar-responsive kinetic installation that functionally emulates azobenzene photoswitching. The sculpture is a picnic table whose geometry symbolizes an azobenzene molecule and is intended to change form at sunrise and sunset to reflect molecular switching. The report should integrate as photochemical grounding E/Z isomerization centered on the N=N unit. It should also integrate photochemical principles (light-induced isomerization, thermal relaxation) with engineering design reasoning (geometry, actuation, materials, control) to show how daily sunlight cycles can drive reversible structural change that visibly represents the underlying molecular mechanism.
