Write a professional analytical paper on mode-specific vibrational control of chemical reactivity, using the reaction of atomic fluorine with partially deuterated methane (CHD₃) as a case study. The paper should examine how infrared excitation of the C–H stretch affects reaction probability and why the observed outcome contradicts the classical Polanyi rules. The analysis must integrate both theoretical and experimental perspectives to explain the mechanistic basis for reactivity inhibition, and discuss a broader section on vibrational energy control in chemistry, particularly how bond-specific excitation can modulate reaction pathways and selectivity in other systems.
