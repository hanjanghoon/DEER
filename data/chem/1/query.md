Write a professional academic review on organic A-site cations that can independently form three-dimensional lead halide perovskite frameworks (general formula A–Pb–X₃, with X ∈ {Cl, Br, I}). The review is a neutral, expert overview establishing theory, surveying credible candidates, and articulating implications for materials design without presupposing which cations qualify. The review should integrate:
- The geometric stability criteria and their physical meaning
- Comparative assessment of established vs. proposed cations
- Case-study-level analysis applying these criteria to a representative organic cation
- Synthesis of implications for lattice stability, band-gap engineering, and materials design in optoelectronic applications

The report should be evidence-based with a justified catalog of organic A-site cations currently supported as independent 3D formers.
