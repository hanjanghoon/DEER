1) Theoretical Framework and Conceptual Accuracy
The report must define and explain the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) and the octahedral factor (μ), including full mathematical expressions and physical meaning in ionic packing and lattice distortion. It must specify accepted stability ranges (e.g., 0.8 ≤ t ≤ 1.0; 0.41 ≤ μ ≤ 0.9) and describe how deviations influence transitions between 3D, layered, or non-perovskite phases.

2) Comprehensiveness of A-Site Cation Survey
The review must list and describe established A-site cations capable of forming 3D halide perovskites (e.g., methylammonium (MA⁺), formamidinium (FA⁺), cesium (Cs⁺)), and evaluate additional organic candidates such as aziridinium (AZ⁺), ethylammonium (EA⁺), dimethylammonium (DMA⁺), and methylhydrazinium (MHy⁺). Each candidate must be analyzed theoretically and empirically, with credible literature or computational studies, clarifying which species independently stabilize 3D frameworks vs. quasi-2D/distorted structures.

3) Quantitative Analysis and Data Integrity
The report must include a quantitative table or calculation showing t and μ for all major cations, derived from consistent ionic-radius sources. For each candidate, the paper must interpret whether values fall within or outside the 3D stability window and discuss margin sensitivity. For aziridinium, the text must note that t ≈ 0.95 for AZPbBr₃ and explain why this indicates a robust geometric fit for 3D formation.

4) Integration of Empirical and Theoretical Evidence
The report must cite or summarize peer-reviewed experimental findings that validate or refute each cation’s perovskite formability. Studies confirming aziridinium-based perovskites and related phases ([1]–[4]) must be included and interpreted, explicitly connecting each cation’s computed metrics to experimental behavior.

5) Comparative Reasoning and Deviation Explanation
The paper must analyze why certain organic cations (e.g., EA⁺, DMA⁺) fail to stabilize 3D perovskites, relating this to molecular size, shape asymmetry, hydrogen bonding, or conformational flexibility. It must distinguish geometric incompatibility from electronic/dipolar effects. Comparative reasoning should be tabulated or clearly structured.

6) Structural and Electronic Implications
The paper must discuss how A-site geometry, dipole moment, and polarizability influence lattice distortion, band-gap tuning, and charge-transport properties, linking molecular design choices to macroscopic optoelectronic behavior (stability, band-edge alignment, thermal robustness).

7) Outcome and Conclusion Validity
The conclusion must synthesize results into a justified catalog of all organic A-site cations currently supported by theoretical and empirical evidence as capable of independently forming 3D lead halide perovskites. The correct outcome must identify methylammonium (MA⁺), formamidinium (FA⁺), cesium (Cs⁺), and aziridinium (AZ⁺) as meeting all criteria, while clearly excluding non-qualifying cations. Justification must rest on logical evaluation and published validation.
