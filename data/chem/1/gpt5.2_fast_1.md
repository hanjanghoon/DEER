# Organic A-Site Cations Capable of Independently Forming Three-Dimensional Lead Halide Perovskite Frameworks (A–Pb–X₃)

## Abstract

Hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites with general formula A–Pb–X₃ (X = Cl, Br, I) have emerged as central materials in optoelectronics, driven by their exceptional optoelectronic properties and solution processability. While a broad range of organic ammonium cations have been incorporated into layered or low-dimensional lead halide frameworks, only a very restricted subset can independently stabilize a three-dimensional (3D) corner-sharing PbX₆ octahedral network. This review provides a neutral, theory-driven assessment of organic A-site cations that are experimentally supported as independent 3D perovskite formers. We examine geometric stability criteria and their physical interpretation, compare established and proposed organic cations, and apply these criteria in a case-study analysis of a representative organic ammonium. We conclude by synthesizing implications for lattice stability, band-gap engineering, and materials design in optoelectronic applications, emphasizing the narrow but instructive design space for organic A-site engineering in 3D lead halide perovskites.

## 1. Introduction

The ABX₃ perovskite structure, originally formulated for oxide ceramics, has been successfully extended to halide systems in which a divalent metal cation (B = Pb²⁺ or Sn²⁺) is octahedrally coordinated by halide anions (X = Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) and charge-balanced by a monovalent A-site cation [1]. In hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites, the A site is occupied by an organic cation, most commonly methylammonium (MA⁺, CH₃NH₃⁺), giving rise to materials such as MAPbI₃ that combine inorganic lattice rigidity with organic compositional tunability [2].

Despite the apparent chemical flexibility of organic cations, the ability to independently stabilize a 3D perovskite framework is highly constrained. Many organic ammonium cations that are synthetically accessible instead yield layered Ruddlesden–Popper phases, Dion–Jacobson phases, or other low-dimensional structures due to steric incompatibility with the cuboctahedral A site [3]. As a result, a central materials-design question concerns which organic cations genuinely qualify as independent 3D A-site occupants in lead halide perovskites, and why.

This review focuses specifically on organic A-site cations that can **independently** form a 3D PbX₆ corner-sharing network, without requiring co-occupancy with inorganic cations (e.g., Cs⁺) or inducing dimensional reduction. The goal is not to expand the list speculatively, but to clarify the geometric, energetic, and physical constraints that govern this selectivity.

## 2. Structural Requirements for 3D Lead Halide Perovskites

### 2.1 The Perovskite Framework

In the ideal cubic perovskite structure, the B-site cation resides at the center of an octahedron formed by six X anions, while the A-site cation occupies a cuboctahedral cavity defined by eight BX₆ octahedra [1]. Structural stability depends on the simultaneous satisfaction of B–X bonding preferences and efficient space filling by the A-site species.

For lead halide perovskites, the Pb–X framework is relatively soft and tolerant of distortions, yet still imposes strict steric limits on the size and shape of the A-site cation [4].

### 2.2 Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor and Its Physical Meaning

The Goldschmidt tolerance factor ( t ) is defined as:

[
t = \frac{r_A + r_X}{\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_X)}
]

where ( r_A ), ( r_B ), and ( r_X ) are the effective ionic radii of the A-site cation, B-site cation, and anion, respectively [5].

For inorganic oxide perovskites, stable 3D structures typically occur for ( 0.8 \lesssim t \lesssim 1.0 ). In hybrid lead halide systems, this window shifts slightly due to the polarizability of halides and the non-spherical nature of organic cations, but empirical studies suggest a functional stability range of approximately ( 0.8 \lesssim t \lesssim 1.05 ) [6].

Physically, the tolerance factor reflects the balance between:

* Efficient packing of the A-site cation,
* Avoidance of excessive octahedral tilting,
* Maintenance of corner-sharing connectivity.

Values of ( t ) significantly above unity typically lead to layered or hexagonal phases, while values well below unity destabilize the framework via excessive tilting or vacancy formation [7].

### 2.3 Octahedral Factor and Complementary Criteria

The octahedral factor ( \mu = r_B / r_X ) describes the stability of BX₆ octahedra themselves. For Pb²⁺ halides, ( \mu ) comfortably lies within the stable range, meaning that A-site selection is the dominant variable controlling dimensionality [8].

Additional descriptors—such as hydrogen-bonding propensity, dipole moment, and rotational freedom—modulate stability but do not override gross steric incompatibility [9].

## 3. Organic A-Site Cations: Established and Proposed Candidates

### 3.1 Established Independent 3D Organic A-Site Cations

#### 3.1.1 Methylammonium (CH₃NH₃⁺)

Methylammonium (MA⁺) is the canonical organic A-site cation and remains the most extensively characterized example. MAPbI₃, MAPbBr₃, and MAPbCl₃ all crystallize in 3D perovskite frameworks across accessible temperature ranges [2].

The effective radius of MA⁺ (~2.17 Å) places it well within the tolerance factor window for Pb–halide frameworks [6]. Extensive diffraction and spectroscopic studies confirm that MA⁺ does not disrupt octahedral connectivity, despite dynamic orientational disorder [10].

#### 3.1.2 Formamidinium (HC(NH₂)₂⁺)

Formamidinium (FA⁺) has a slightly larger effective radius (~2.53 Å) than MA⁺ and stabilizes 3D perovskite phases such as FAPbI₃ under appropriate conditions [11]. While the black α-phase of FAPbI₃ is metastable at room temperature relative to a non-perovskite δ-phase, it is nonetheless a genuine 3D perovskite former when kinetically or compositionally stabilized [12].

Crucially, FA⁺ alone satisfies the geometric requirements for a 3D framework, even if thermodynamic competition with lower-dimensional polymorphs exists [11].

---

### 3.2 Proposed but Constrained Organic Cations

#### 3.2.1 Ethylammonium (CH₃CH₂NH₃⁺)

Ethylammonium (EA⁺) has been explored as an A-site cation due to its modest size increase relative to MA⁺. However, pure EAPbX₃ compounds do not form stable 3D perovskite phases under ambient conditions; instead, EA⁺ typically induces layered or distorted structures [13].

Mixed-cation systems (e.g., EA⁺/MA⁺) can incorporate EA⁺ as a partial occupant, but EA⁺ does not independently stabilize a 3D framework [14].

#### 3.2.2 Guanidinium (C(NH₂)₃⁺)

Guanidinium (GUA⁺) is nearly planar and significantly larger than FA⁺. Although it can hydrogen-bond strongly to halides, its size places it outside the tolerance factor window for 3D APbX₃ frameworks. Experimentally, GUA⁺ yields layered perovskites or non-perovskite phases [15].

---

### 3.3 Summary of Experimental Evidence

Across the literature, only **methylammonium** and **formamidinium** are consistently supported as organic cations capable of independently forming 3D lead halide perovskites with corner-sharing octahedra [2,11]. Other organic ammonium cations either require co-cations, induce dimensional reduction, or fail to stabilize the perovskite topology altogether.

---

## 4. Case-Study Analysis: Formamidinium as a Borderline 3D Former

Formamidinium provides a useful case study because it lies near the upper boundary of the tolerance factor window.

### 4.1 Geometric Considerations

Using reported effective ionic radii, FA⁺ yields a tolerance factor near unity for iodide systems [6]. This marginal fit explains both its ability to form a 3D framework and its susceptibility to octahedral tilting and polymorphism.

### 4.2 Structural Dynamics and Phase Stability

In α-FAPbI₃, the FA⁺ cation exhibits restricted rotational dynamics compared to MA⁺, increasing lattice strain and favoring a hexagonal δ-phase at room temperature [12]. Nonetheless, the existence of a crystallographically verified 3D phase confirms that FA⁺ satisfies the fundamental geometric criteria.

### 4.3 Implications of the Case Study

FA⁺ demonstrates that independent 3D formation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for long-term phase stability. The case highlights how proximity to geometric limits amplifies the importance of entropy, hydrogen bonding, and lattice dynamics.

---

## 5. Implications for Materials Design

### 5.1 Lattice Stability

The narrow set of viable organic A-site cations underscores that lattice stability in 3D lead halide perovskites is dominated by steric constraints rather than chemical diversity [7]. Attempts to expand the A-site palette must confront fundamental geometric limits.

### 5.2 Band-Gap Engineering

While A-site cations do not directly contribute electronic states near the band edges, they indirectly influence band gaps through lattice distortion and octahedral tilting [16]. MA⁺ and FA⁺ differ measurably in band gap and carrier effective mass due to these structural effects.

### 5.3 Optoelectronic Applications

For photovoltaics and light-emitting devices, the restricted set of organic 3D formers motivates mixed-cation and mixed-halide strategies rather than wholesale replacement of the A-site species [17]. Understanding why only certain cations qualify helps rationalize these empirical design choices.

---

## 6. Conclusions

A rigorous, evidence-based assessment reveals that only a very limited set of organic A-site cations—principally methylammonium and formamidinium—are currently supported as independent stabilizers of 3D lead halide perovskite frameworks. This restriction arises from geometric constraints encoded in the tolerance factor and reinforced by lattice-dynamical considerations. Case-study analysis of formamidinium illustrates how marginal geometric compatibility can permit 3D formation while compromising thermodynamic stability.

These findings suggest that future innovation in hybrid perovskites is more likely to emerge from compositional engineering within this constrained space than from discovering fundamentally new organic 3D A-site cations.
