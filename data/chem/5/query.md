Write a professional theoretical paper exploring periodic bonding and crystal formation in a two-dimensional universe, focusing on the hypothetical compound NiC. The goal is to determine its likely bonding topology and anisotropy under the given constraints: electrons are spin-½ fermions, orbital filling follows conventional aufbau ordering, promotion does not occur, and chemical stability arises from filled subshells. The paper should establish the quantum-mechanical basis for 2D atomic structure, derive representative electronic configurations, and compare the resulting bonding behavior to that of real-world layered materials.
