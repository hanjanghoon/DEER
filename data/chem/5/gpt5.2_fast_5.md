# Periodic Bonding and Crystal Formation in a Two-Dimensional Universe: A Theoretical Study of NiC

## Abstract

The structure of matter in reduced dimensionality poses fundamental questions for quantum mechanics, chemistry, and materials science. Two-dimensional (2D) universes are not merely mathematical curiosities; they provide a controlled setting for isolating the essential principles governing bonding, periodicity, and stability. In this paper, we develop a professional theoretical framework for atomic structure, chemical bonding, and crystal formation in a strictly two-dimensional universe populated by spin-½ fermionic electrons obeying conventional aufbau filling rules, with no orbital promotion and with chemical stability arising exclusively from filled subshells. Within this framework, we examine a hypothetical binary compound, NiC, as a representative case study.

We first establish the quantum-mechanical basis for atoms confined to two spatial dimensions, emphasizing how angular momentum quantization, orbital degeneracies, and shell structure differ from three-dimensional (3D) atoms. We then derive plausible 2D electronic configurations for nickel-like and carbon-like species and analyze how filled subshell constraints dictate bonding possibilities. Using these results, we propose likely bonding topologies for NiC, argue for pronounced bonding anisotropy, and explore candidate 2D crystal lattices consistent with subshell closure. Finally, we compare the predicted behavior of 2D NiC to real-world layered and quasi-2D materials such as graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, and metal carbides, highlighting both deep analogies and fundamental departures. The analysis demonstrates that even under severe dimensional constraints, periodic bonding and crystal formation can emerge, but with anisotropy and coordination rules that differ qualitatively from those in three dimensions.

## 1. Introduction

Dimensionality is one of the most profound organizing principles in physics and chemistry. Many structural, electronic, and chemical properties of matter depend not only on composition but also on the number of spatial dimensions available to particles and fields. While our physical universe is three-dimensional, reduced-dimensional systems—surfaces, interfaces, thin films, and atomically thin materials—exhibit behaviors that deviate markedly from their bulk counterparts [1]. These systems motivate a deeper theoretical question: how would chemistry itself reorganize in a universe that is intrinsically two-dimensional?

A two-dimensional universe, in which both nuclei and electrons are confined to a plane, challenges many assumptions implicit in standard chemical intuition. Orbital shapes, angular momentum quantization, degeneracy patterns, and bonding geometries are all altered when one spatial degree of freedom is removed [2]. Nevertheless, fermionic statistics, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Coulomb interactions remain operative. As a result, it is meaningful to ask whether stable atoms, molecules, and crystals could exist in such a universe, and if so, what forms they would take.

In this paper, we explore these questions through the lens of a specific hypothetical compound: NiC. The choice of NiC is deliberate. Nickel, as a transition-metal element in our universe, exhibits partially filled d subshells and rich bonding behavior, while carbon is paradigmatic of covalent bonding and low-dimensional structures. By examining their interaction in a 2D universe under strict constraints—no orbital promotion, aufbau filling, and stability derived from filled subshells—we can probe how transition-metal–main-group chemistry might reorganize in reduced dimensionality.

The goals of this paper are threefold. First, we aim to establish a consistent quantum-mechanical description of atomic structure in two dimensions, grounded in well-established principles but adapted to planar geometry. Second, we seek to derive representative electronic configurations for Ni-like and C-like atoms and ions under these constraints. Third, we analyze how these configurations dictate bonding topology, anisotropy, and crystal formation in a hypothetical 2D NiC solid, and we compare the results to real layered materials known in our universe.

## 2. Quantum-Mechanical Foundations of Atoms in Two Dimensions

### 2.1 Schrödinger Equation in Two Dimensions

The nonrelativistic electronic structure of atoms is governed by the Schrödinger equation. In three dimensions, the hydrogenic problem admits solutions characterized by principal, orbital, and magnetic quantum numbers. In two dimensions, the mathematical structure changes significantly. The Schrödinger equation for an electron of mass ( m ) in a Coulomb potential confined to a plane is given by

[
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla_{2D}^2 \psi(r,\phi) - \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r} \psi(r,\phi) = E \psi(r,\phi),
]

where ( \nabla_{2D}^2 ) is the two-dimensional Laplacian, ( r ) is the radial coordinate in the plane, and ( \phi ) is the polar angle [3].

Despite superficial similarity to the 3D case, the spectrum and degeneracies differ. The effective centrifugal term in two dimensions alters the radial equation, and the allowed angular momentum quantum numbers are integers ( m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots ), corresponding to planar rotations rather than full spherical harmonics [4].

### 2.2 Angular Momentum and Orbital Structure

In two dimensions, orbital angular momentum has only one component perpendicular to the plane. As a result, orbitals are classified by a single angular momentum quantum number ( m ), rather than the ( l ) and ( m_l ) of three dimensions. The absence of a third dimension removes the degeneracy associated with different spatial orientations of orbitals [2].

The lowest-energy orbital corresponds to ( m = 0 ), analogous to an s orbital but strictly planar. Higher angular momentum states (( |m| = 1, 2, \dots )) resemble p-, d-, and higher orbitals in that they possess angular nodes, but their nodal structures are fundamentally two-dimensional. Importantly, each value of ( |m| ) corresponds to two states (( \pm m )), except for ( m = 0 ).

### 2.3 Spin, Pauli Principle, and Degeneracy

Electrons remain spin-½ fermions in this hypothetical universe. Each spatial orbital can therefore accommodate two electrons of opposite spin, consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle. However, because orbital degeneracies are reduced in two dimensions, shell capacities differ from those in three dimensions [5].

For example, the ( m = 0 ) shell can hold two electrons, while the ( |m| = 1 ) shell can hold four electrons (two values of ( m ), each with two spin states). This modified degeneracy has profound implications for periodicity and chemical valence.

## 3. Aufbau Ordering and Subshell Filling in Two Dimensions

### 3.1 Energy Ordering of 2D Orbitals

In three dimensions, the aufbau principle reflects the relative energies of orbitals determined by both principal quantum number and angular momentum. In two dimensions, the energy ordering of orbitals follows a different pattern but remains systematic. Solutions to the 2D Coulomb problem indicate that energy depends primarily on a combined radial and angular quantum number, often denoted ( n_r + |m| ) [3].

As a result, lower angular momentum orbitals tend to be stabilized relative to higher ones, but the spacing between shells is altered. The essential assumption in this work is that electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy without promotion, meaning that partially filled subshells do not rearrange to facilitate bonding.

### 3.2 Subshell Closure and Chemical Stability

A central constraint of this study is that chemical stability arises from filled subshells. This mirrors the role of noble-gas configurations in three-dimensional chemistry, where closed-shell atoms exhibit chemical inertness [6]. In two dimensions, subshell closure occurs at different electron counts due to altered degeneracy.

For instance, closure of the ( m = 0 ) subshell yields a 2-electron “noble” configuration. Closure of the combined ( m = 0 ) and ( |m| = 1 ) subshells yields a 6-electron configuration, analogous in some respects to neon in three dimensions. These closure points define a 2D periodic table with different valence patterns.

## 4. Two-Dimensional Analogues of Nickel and Carbon

### 4.1 Carbon-Like Atoms in Two Dimensions

In our universe, carbon has six electrons, filling the 1s and partially filling the 2p subshells. In two dimensions, a carbon-like atom with six electrons would fill the ( m = 0 ) and ( |m| = 1 ) subshells completely, resulting in a closed-shell configuration [5].

Such an atom would be chemically inert under the strict filled-subshell criterion. To recover bonding behavior analogous to carbon’s covalency, one must instead consider a carbon-like atom with fewer electrons in its outer subshell, such as four electrons beyond the inner closed shell. This highlights a fundamental difference between 2D and 3D chemistry: elements that are strongly covalent in three dimensions may become inert in two dimensions if their subshells close prematurely.

### 4.2 Nickel-Like Atoms in Two Dimensions

Nickel in three dimensions has the electron configuration [Ar]3d⁸4s², with partially filled d orbitals contributing to metallic and covalent bonding. In two dimensions, the analogue of d orbitals corresponds to ( |m| = 2 ) states. A nickel-like atom with a large nuclear charge would fill lower ( m ) subshells before occupying these higher angular momentum states.

Under the no-promotion constraint, a Ni-like atom in two dimensions is likely to possess partially filled ( |m| = 2 ) subshells, rendering it chemically active. However, the reduced degeneracy of these subshells limits the number of available bonding directions and favors anisotropic interactions.

## 5. Bonding Principles in a Two-Dimensional Universe

### 5.1 Directionality and Coordination Constraints

In two dimensions, atoms cannot arrange bonds in three-dimensional space to minimize repulsion. Instead, all bonding interactions must lie in a plane. This restriction amplifies anisotropy and constrains coordination numbers. While sixfold coordination is common in close-packed 2D lattices, electronic constraints may favor lower coordination when directional orbitals are involved [7].

For NiC, bonding is expected to arise from overlap between partially filled Ni-like orbitals and available valence states on the C-like atom. Given filled-subshell stability requirements, bonding must not disrupt closed subshells excessively, favoring localized, directional bonds rather than delocalized metallic bonding.

### 5.2 Covalent versus Ionic Character

The relative electronegativities of Ni-like and C-like atoms in two dimensions are determined by effective nuclear charge and orbital energies. The filled-subshell constraint disfavors extensive charge transfer if it leads to open shells. As a result, NiC bonding in two dimensions is expected to exhibit mixed covalent–ionic character, with partial charge redistribution but strong directionality [6].

## 6. Likely Bonding Topology of Two-Dimensional NiC

### 6.1 Stoichiometry and Local Environments

The simplest stoichiometry, NiC, suggests a 1:1 ratio in the plane. Given anisotropic bonding tendencies, a plausible topology consists of alternating Ni-like and C-like atoms arranged in a rectangular or distorted hexagonal lattice. Each Ni-like atom may coordinate to two or three C-like neighbors, consistent with limited directional orbitals.

### 6.2 Anisotropy and Chain Formation

One striking consequence of two-dimensional orbital structure is the propensity for chain or ribbon-like motifs. If bonding orbitals align preferentially along a single direction, NiC may form quasi-one-dimensional chains embedded in a two-dimensional lattice. Such anisotropy is reminiscent of real materials with strong in-plane bonding anisotropy, such as black phosphorus [8].

### 6.3 Crystal Symmetry Considerations

Symmetry in 2D crystals is described by plane groups rather than space groups. The reduced symmetry imposed by directional bonding suggests that NiC may adopt a low-symmetry plane group, possibly rectangular rather than hexagonal. This contrasts with isotropic 2D lattices like graphene, where equivalent bonding directions dominate [9].

## 7. Comparison with Real-World Layered Materials

### 7.1 Graphene and 2D Covalent Networks

Graphene provides a paradigmatic example of 2D covalent bonding, with sp² hybridization yielding a hexagonal lattice [9]. In our hypothetical 2D universe, true sp² hybridization does not occur because orbital mixing differs fundamentally. Nevertheless, the emergence of extended planar networks in NiC echoes graphene’s robustness, albeit with greater anisotropy.

### 7.2 Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides

Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit strong in-plane bonding and weaker interlayer interactions [10]. Although these materials exist in a 3D universe, their electronic structure is quasi-2D. NiC in a strictly 2D universe shares with TMDs the involvement of transition-metal d-like states and directional bonding, suggesting analogous electronic anisotropy.

### 7.3 Metal Carbides and Directional Bonding

In three dimensions, metal carbides display a spectrum of bonding types, from ionic to covalent to metallic [11]. The hypothetical 2D NiC studied here most closely resembles covalent or directional carbides, where metal–carbon bonding is strong and localized. The filled-subshell constraint suppresses metallic delocalization, pushing the system toward semiconducting or insulating behavior.

## 8. Implications for Periodicity and Materials Design in Two Dimensions

The analysis of NiC highlights broader principles governing chemistry in two dimensions. Periodicity persists, but the spacing and character of “groups” and “periods” differ from the familiar 3D periodic table. Transition-metal behavior remains rich, yet more constrained, with anisotropy emerging as a dominant feature rather than an exception.

From a materials-design perspective, a 2D universe would favor crystals with strong directional bonds, low coordination numbers, and pronounced anisotropic properties. Electronic transport, mechanical response, and reactivity would likely vary dramatically with direction, offering a fundamentally different landscape for functional materials.

## 9. Conclusions

We have developed a theoretical framework for understanding periodic bonding and crystal formation in a two-dimensional universe and applied it to a hypothetical compound, NiC. Starting from quantum-mechanical principles adapted to planar geometry, we derived modified orbital structures, subshell capacities, and aufbau filling rules. Under the constraints of no orbital promotion and stability arising from filled subshells, we showed that bonding remains possible but becomes highly anisotropic.

For NiC, the most plausible bonding topology involves directional Ni–C interactions leading to low-symmetry 2D lattices or chain-like motifs. Comparison with real-world layered materials reveals both analogies—such as strong in-plane bonding—and fundamental differences rooted in dimensionality and orbital structure. Overall, this study demonstrates that chemistry in two dimensions is not merely a reduced version of three-dimensional chemistry, but a distinct and internally consistent framework with its own periodicity, bonding rules, and materials possibilities.
