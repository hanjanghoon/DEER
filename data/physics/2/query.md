Write a professional academic paper on the determination of the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum for spin-2 modes in a 5-dimensional warped compactification.
The core objective is to systematically derive the relevant mass eigenvalue equation and to analyze its spectral properties as determined by the geometry of the extra dimension, with a specific focus on the model defined by the warp factor A(x) = sin(x) + 4 cos(x).
The paper must include the following analysis:
1.A rigorous derivation of the second-order differential operator that governs the masses of the transverse-traceless spin-2 Kaluza-Klein modes.
2.A clear demonstration of the transformation that maps the derived eigenvalue equation into a one-dimensional Schrödinger-like problem, including the explicit form of the resulting potential.
3.A detailed spectral analysis of the eigenvalue problem for the specified warp factor, applying a sound method to solve for the mass-squared eigenvalues.
4.A quantitative conclusion based on the calculated spectrum, identifying the number of eigenvalues below the numerical value of 14.
