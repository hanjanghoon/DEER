Write a professional technical paper on the principles governing the external characterization of radiofrequency resonant circuits via inductive coupling.
The core objective is to systematically analyze the physical mechanisms and design principles that determine the visibility of a resonance signature, providing a theoretical foundation for the observation that some functional MRI coils may appear non-resonant to an external probe.
The paper must include the following analysis:
1.A rigorous analysis based on coupled-mode theory or an equivalent circuit model that describes the interaction between a probe and a resonant circuit.
2.A systematic analysis of how the geometric design of a resonant coil and the spatial distribution of its near-fields influence its coupling efficiency to an external probe.
3.A detailed analysis of the role of active and passive electronic circuits integrated with the resonant structure and their impact on external field coupling.
4.A synthesis of the geometric and electronic factors to provide a comprehensive explanation for the conditions under which a functional resonant circuit can become undetectable to an inductive probe.
