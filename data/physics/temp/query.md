Write a professional academic paper on the nature of particle dynamics and contact networks in disordered solids near the jamming transition.
The core objective is to systematically analyze the structural and dynamical heterogeneity in jammed systems, leading to a classification of particles based on their local contact environment, including the identification of under-constrained particles with z ≈ d+1 contacts.
The paper must include the following analysis:
1.A rigorous presentation of the concept of the jamming transition in hard sphere systems, covering isostaticity, the caging effect, and the emergence of rigidity.
2.A detailed analysis of the contact network topology in a jammed solid, focusing on the average coordination number and the distribution of contact numbers.
3.An investigation into the classification of particles within the jammed state, requiring a clear analysis of the distinction between fully constrained particles and those with fewer contacts.
4.A detailed characterization of the under-constrained particles, including their typical contact number and characteristic dynamics, leading to the identification of their established name in the literature.
