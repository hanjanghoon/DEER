The core assessment criterion for this paper is its ability to correctly apply empirical range-energy formalisms to solve a specific problem in particle energy loss, demonstrating a clear understanding of the underlying physics and the assumptions involved.
First, the foundational concepts must be correctly defined and related. The paper must accurately define range, residual range, stopping power -dE/dx, and energy straggling. It must correctly state the qualitative relationship between these quantities as described by the Bragg curve.
Second, the choice and application of the empirical range-energy relation must be appropriate and accurate. The paper must select a suitable empirical formula that connects range and energy, such as a power-law approximation of the form R = aE^b. The parameters of this model, a and b, must be correctly determined from the given initial conditions and the implicit condition at zero energy.
Third, the calculation of the particle's state at the intermediate point must be correct. The paper must use the established range-energy model to accurately calculate the residual range and, from that, the residual energy of the alpha particle at the 4 cm mark. All steps in this calculation must be shown.
Fourth, the final calculation of the stopping power must be logically sound and correct. The paper must correctly differentiate its range-energy function to find the stopping power dE/dx as a function of energy. It must then substitute the calculated residual energy to find the specific energy loss at the specified point. The final numerical result must be correct and presented with appropriate units.
Finally, the overall structure and presentation must be clear and professional. The paper must be logically structured, proceeding from general principles to the specific application and calculation. The assumptions made, such as neglecting straggling, must be stated. All steps in the derivation and calculation must be transparent and easy to follow.
