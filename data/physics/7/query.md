Write a professional academic paper on the energy loss characteristics of heavy charged particles, such as alpha particles, in matter.
The core objective of this paper is to systematically analyze the relationship between a particle's energy, its position along its trajectory, and its rate of energy loss (stopping power), based on empirical range-energy relations.
The paper must include the following:
1.A rigorous presentation of the concepts of particle range, stopping power (-dE/dx), and the empirical relationships that connect them. This includes a discussion of the general form of the Bragg curve.
2.An analysis of common empirical formulas that model the relationship between the range R and initial energy E₀ for heavy charged particles in a given medium.
3.A clear presentation of the methodology to determine a particle's residual energy E(x) at any point x along its path, given its initial energy and total range.
4.An investigation into the calculation of the specific energy loss per unit length (-dE/dx) at a specified position. This requires applying the derived range-energy formalism to determine the stopping power as a function of position or residual energy.
