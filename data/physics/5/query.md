Write a professional academic paper on the fundamental principles of single-snapshot Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).
The core objective is to systematically analyze the theoretical requirements for reconstructing a 3D spectral data cube from a single 2D measurement, culminating in a derivation of the minimum number of diffraction gratings required.
The paper must include the following analysis:
1.A rigorous mathematical model that represents the imaging process, describing how a 3D data cube (x, y, λ) is projected onto a 2D sensor plane through a dispersive optical system.
2.A clear analysis of how diffraction gratings function as operators that generate the multiple projections required for tomographic inversion.
3.An analysis, based on the principles of computed tomography, of the conditions on the acquired projection data that are necessary for a well-posed reconstruction of the full spectral volume.
4.A derivation of the minimum number of gratings required to satisfy these conditions, thereby establishing the fundamental limit of the system.
