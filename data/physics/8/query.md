Write a professional academic paper on the analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns for crystalline materials with rhombohedral distortions from a parent cubic structure.
The core objective of this paper is to systematically analyze how crystallographic symmetry breaking determines the splitting of Bragg reflections, using the principles of crystallography and diffraction theory.
The paper must include the following:
1.A rigorous presentation of Bragg's law and the concept of crystallographic planes and reciprocal lattice vectors. A clear explanation of how an X-ray diffraction pattern represents a map of the reciprocal lattice.
2.A detailed analysis of the relationship between the cubic (Pm-3m) and rhombohedral (R3m) space groups, focusing on the symmetry operations that are lost during the structural transition.
3.A systematic analysis of how a single family of planes {hkl} in a high-symmetry cubic lattice transforms into multiple, non-equivalent families of planes under a lower-symmetry rhombohedral distortion. This requires applying the symmetry operations of the rhombohedral group to the cubic indices.
4.An investigation into the specific splitting patterns for the {200}, {220}, and {222} families of planes when transitioning from the cubic to the R3m rhombohedral structure.
