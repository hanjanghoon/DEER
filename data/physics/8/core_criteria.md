The core assessment criterion for this paper is its ability to correctly predict the splitting of X-ray diffraction peaks by applying the principles of crystallographic symmetry breaking to a specific structural transition.
First, the foundational principles of crystallography and diffraction must be correctly stated. The paper must accurately define crystal planes, the {hkl} notation for a family of planes, and the concept that each unique family of planes under the crystal's point group symmetry produces a single Bragg reflection. The relationship between real-space planes and reciprocal lattice points must be clear.
Second, the symmetry analysis must be correct and systematic. The paper must correctly identify the full set of symmetry operations for the parent cubic group Pm-3m and the daughter rhombohedral group R3m. It must correctly describe how the original set of symmetry-equivalent planes in the cubic system is partitioned into smaller, distinct sets under the reduced symmetry of the rhombohedral system.
Third, the application of symmetry operations to determine peak splitting must be rigorous and accurate. The paper must systematically apply the symmetry operations of the R3m group to a representative plane from each cubic family {200}, {220}, and {222} to generate all the planes in each new rhombohedral family. The counting of the resulting distinct families, which corresponds to the number of split peaks, must be correct for each case.
Fourth, the final conclusions regarding the number of reflections must be correct. The paper must provide the correct number of expected Bragg reflections for each of the specified families of planes. The results must be a direct and logical consequence of the preceding symmetry analysis, not merely a stated number.
Finally, the overall presentation must be clear and professional. The paper must be logically structured, guiding the reader from general principles of symmetry to the specific application. The use of crystallographic notation for planes, families of planes, and space groups must be standard and consistent.
