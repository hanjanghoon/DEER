Write a professional technical paper on the methodology for calculating the magnetic helicity of plasma waves from single-point spacecraft measurements.
The core objective is to systematically analyze the role of coordinate system transformations in deriving physically meaningful wave properties, thereby justifying the standard data analysis procedure used for Alfvén Ion Cyclotron waves at the L1 point.
The paper must include the following analysis:
1.A rigorous definition of normalized magnetic helicity and a clear explanation of its relationship to the polarization of plasma waves.
2.A detailed analysis of the standard coordinate systems used for organizing spacecraft data and the physically necessary field-aligned coordinate system for wave analysis.
3.A clear and complete presentation of the mathematical procedure required to transform magnetic field vector data from a standard instrument-based coordinate system to a local magnetic field-aligned coordinate system.
4.A conclusive demonstration that the practical calculation of helicity involves first transforming the data into the field-aligned frame, thereby resolving any apparent discrepancy with theoretical definitions.
