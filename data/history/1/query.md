Write a professional academic paper on the  early experimentation with English poetic form and rhyme by Geoffrey Chaucer, specifically in The Book of the Dutchess. The study should investigate whether any word  in the poem resists attempts at rhyme and postulate as to why this may occur

The paper should include the following aspects : 

- An analysis of Middle English pronunciation
- Chaucer’s metrical technique
- Chaucer’s poetic intentions
- Possible linguistic or phonetic reasons for Chaucer’s failure to rhyme this word
- A comparison with Chaucer’s rhyme techniques and practices in later works, such as The Canterbury Tales.
- The specific context / significance of the use of the unrhymed word and whether this may have a bearing in his decision
- Textual evidence and reference to scholarly commentary on Chaucer’s rhyme and dialectical choices.
