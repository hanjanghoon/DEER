The paper must produce a focused, evidence-based argument identifying the specific unrhymed word in The Book of the Duchess and evaluating what it reveals about Middle English sound, Chaucer’s metrical strategy, and poetic intention. A comparison should be made with Chaucer’s later rhyme practices.

The paper should extend beyond merely identifying the word. It is necessary to synthesize all aspects to identify the word and to summarize the reasons behind the failure to rhyme; i.e., it should analyze why Chaucer avoids the rhyme—is it due to humor, structure, experimentation, or phonetic limitations? It should thus:

1. The paper must identify the word correctly and reference exactly where it occurs (line/stanza).

2. The paper should show an awareness of Middle English, sound shifts, and how Chaucer’s dialect affects sound possibilities. It should address whether phonology (vowel/consonant inventory, stress, dialectal form) makes the word difficult to rhyme. Plausible rhyme candidates should be suggested. The paper must use Standard Middle English pronunciation to reconstruct the likely phonetic shape of the word.

3. The paper must include a metrical and structural analysis of the poem. Medieval rhyme practices in general should be examined.

4. The paper must address Chaucer’s intentions—whether the irregularity could have been intentional (metrical break, semantic emphasis, rhetorical device). A contextual analysis should focus on the semantic focal points and narrative function to determine intentionality. There should be a discussion on the context of the word and any bearing this may have on the choice not to rhyme.

5. The paper must draw connections to Chaucer’s broader poetic methods, comparing his later practices. Parallel examples from The Canterbury Tales, where Chaucer either avoids rhyme or uses irregular rhyme, should be given. The rhetorical effect should be compared in each instance. Other lexical items in Chaucer’s corpus that rhyme with that phonetic shape should be looked for to determine usage and whether the unrhymed effect persists or is resolved in later works.

6. The paper must incorporate discussion or citations from recognized Chaucer scholars or authoritative commentaries by major editors and commentators, using correct referencing. It should demonstrate independent interpretation or synthesis of scholarly perspectives, not just a summary.
