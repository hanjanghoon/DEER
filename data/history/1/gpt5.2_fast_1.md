# Early Experimentation with English Poetic Form and Rhyme in *The Book of the Duchess*: Chaucer, Rhyme-Resistance, and the Emergence of a Vernacular Poetics

## Abstract

Geoffrey Chaucer’s *The Book of the Duchess* (c. 1368–1372) occupies a formative position in the history of English poetry, marking one of the earliest sustained attempts to adapt Continental rhyme-based forms to Middle English verse. While the poem is largely written in octosyllabic rhyming couplets modeled on French courtly poetry, scholars have long noted moments of strain, irregularity, and apparent failure in Chaucer’s handling of rhyme. This paper investigates the hypothesis that at least one lexical item in *The Book of the Duchess* resists effective rhyming within Chaucer’s system, and examines why this resistance may occur. Integrating analysis of Middle English pronunciation, Chaucer’s early metrical technique, and his poetic intentions, the study explores linguistic, phonetic, and dialectal explanations for rhyme difficulty. It further situates this phenomenon within Chaucer’s broader poetic development by comparing his rhyme practices in *The Book of the Duchess* with the more confident and systematic rhyming of *The Canterbury Tales*. Drawing on textual evidence and scholarly commentary, the paper argues that rhyme resistance in *The Book of the Duchess* reflects both the constraints of Middle English phonology and Chaucer’s transitional moment as a poet negotiating between inherited French forms and an emergent English literary language.

## 1. Introduction: Chaucer at the Threshold of English Rhyme

Geoffrey Chaucer is often described as the poet who “made English literary,” not because English verse did not exist before him, but because he demonstrated—more fully than any predecessor—that English could sustain the complex metrical and rhyming structures associated with prestigious French and Italian traditions [1]. *The Book of the Duchess*, generally regarded as Chaucer’s earliest major poem, is a crucial test case for this achievement. Composed as an elegy for Blanche of Lancaster, it adapts the French *dit amoureux* tradition into English octosyllabic couplets, a form not native to Old English alliterative verse [2].

Yet Chaucer’s success in this early experiment is not uniform. Scholars have observed metrical looseness, variable stress patterns, and occasional rhyme irregularities that largely disappear in his later work [3]. Among these irregularities is the phenomenon of words that appear to resist rhyme: lexical items that recur without rhyme partners, or that force Chaucer into strained or approximate rhymes. This paper focuses on this phenomenon, asking whether *The Book of the Duchess* contains a word that effectively remains unrhymed, and if so, why.

The investigation proceeds on several levels. First, it examines Middle English pronunciation and rhyme theory to clarify what constitutes a “failed” or “resistant” rhyme in Chaucer’s linguistic environment. Second, it analyzes Chaucer’s metrical technique in *The Book of the Duchess*, identifying structural pressures that might limit rhyme choice. Third, it explores Chaucer’s poetic intentions, especially the elegiac and affective demands of the poem. Finally, it compares Chaucer’s early rhyme practice with his mature handling of rhyme in *The Canterbury Tales*, in order to assess whether rhyme resistance reflects inexperience, linguistic constraint, or deliberate poetic choice.

## 2. Middle English Pronunciation and the Nature of Rhyme

### 2.1 Phonological Diversity in Fourteenth-Century English

Any discussion of Chaucer’s rhyme must begin with Middle English phonology. Unlike Modern English, Middle English retained a relatively transparent relationship between spelling and pronunciation, but this transparency was complicated by regional variation and ongoing sound change [4]. Chaucer wrote in a London-based dialect influenced by East Midland forms, but his vocabulary included words from French, Anglo-Norman, and other English dialects.

Rhyme in Middle English depends primarily on the identity of stressed vowels and following consonants, not on spelling. For example, words spelled differently may rhyme if their terminal sounds coincide, while words spelled similarly may not rhyme if their vowels differ [5]. Chaucer’s rhymes are therefore a major source of evidence for reconstructing Middle English pronunciation, as famously demonstrated in studies by Henry Sweet and later scholars [6].

### 2.2 What Counts as Rhyme Failure?

A rhyme may “fail” in several ways. First, a word may lack suitable phonological partners within the lexicon available to the poet. Second, a poet may avoid available rhymes because they carry inappropriate semantic or stylistic associations. Third, rhyme failure may be apparent rather than real, arising from modern mispronunciation rather than medieval usage [7].

In *The Book of the Duchess*, most couplets rhyme cleanly by Middle English standards. However, certain lexemes—especially abstract nouns, proper names, or semantically loaded terms—appear infrequently in rhyme position or recur without being paired. One candidate frequently noted by scholars is the word *sorwe* (“sorrow”), a key thematic term in the poem’s elegiac register [8].

## 3. Chaucer’s Metrical Technique in *The Book of the Duchess*

### 3.1 Octosyllabic Couplets and French Influence

*The Book of the Duchess* is written primarily in octosyllabic rhyming couplets, a form Chaucer derived from French poets such as Guillaume de Machaut and Jean de Froissart [9]. This meter requires careful balancing of stress and syllable count, particularly in English, where stress patterns are less predictable than in French.

Chaucer’s control of the meter in this poem is uneven. Lines occasionally contain extra syllables, unresolved stresses, or elisions that seem awkward by later Chaucerian standards [10]. These metrical challenges can interact with rhyme difficulties, as the poet must satisfy both phonological and rhythmic constraints simultaneously.

### 3.2 Rhyme Placement and Lexical Pressure

In Chaucer’s early work, rhyme often dictates lexical choice more strongly than in his later poetry. This is evident in the use of formulaic phrases and semantically light words to complete rhyme pairs [11]. When Chaucer introduces conceptually central terms—such as *sorwe*, *deth*, or *loss*—he sometimes places them away from rhyme position, suggesting an awareness of their phonological or semantic resistance to easy pairing.

In *The Book of the Duchess*, *sorwe* frequently appears in line-internal positions rather than at the end of a couplet, a pattern that contrasts with Chaucer’s later willingness to rhyme emotionally charged words in *The Canterbury Tales* [12].

## 4. Chaucer’s Poetic Intentions and the Elegiac Mode

### 4.1 Elegy and Formal Constraint

As an elegy, *The Book of the Duchess* aims to express grief, consolation, and the ineffability of loss. Medieval elegiac conventions often emphasize the inadequacy of language to fully articulate sorrow [13]. Chaucer’s apparent avoidance of rhyming *sorwe* may thus reflect a thematic alignment between form and meaning: the unassimilable nature of grief is mirrored by the word’s resistance to formal closure through rhyme.

This interpretation aligns with medieval rhetorical theory, which allows for formal irregularity as a means of affective emphasis [14]. A word that resists rhyme can signal semantic weight or emotional excess beyond the poem’s formal system.

### 4.2 Conscious Experimentation versus Technical Limitation

It remains debated whether Chaucer consciously intended such effects in his early work. Some scholars argue that *The Book of the Duchess* already demonstrates sophisticated control of form and meaning [15], while others view its irregularities as signs of apprenticeship [16]. The truth may lie between these positions: Chaucer was experimenting within constraints not yet fully mastered, and these constraints occasionally aligned productively with his thematic goals.

## 5. Linguistic and Phonetic Reasons for Rhyme Resistance

### 5.1 Limited Rhyme Inventory in Middle English

From a purely linguistic perspective, *sorwe* presents phonetic challenges. In Middle English, *sorwe* is typically pronounced /ˈsɔrwə/, with a stressed open-mid back rounded vowel followed by /rw/ and a schwa [17]. Few native English words share this terminal cluster, limiting available rhyme partners.

While French-derived words could potentially rhyme, Chaucer may have avoided them due to register mismatch or semantic incongruity. As a result, the rhyme inventory for *-orwe* is extremely sparse in Chaucer’s lexicon [18].

### 5.2 Dialectal Variation and Audience Reception

Another factor is dialectal variation. Chaucer’s audience included listeners from different regions, whose pronunciation of *sorwe* may have varied. Avoiding rhyme on such a word could reduce the risk of perceived rhyme failure among listeners [19]. This pragmatic consideration reinforces the idea that rhyme resistance is not merely technical but sociolinguistic.

## 6. Comparison with Chaucer’s Later Rhyme Practice in *The Canterbury Tales*

### 6.1 Expansion of Rhyme Resources

By the time Chaucer composed *The Canterbury Tales*, his rhyme practice had become markedly more confident. He employs a wider range of rhyme sounds, including complex polysyllabic rhymes and repeated rhyme sets sustained over many lines [20]. Words expressing abstract states—*sorwe*, *care*, *wo*—are freely rhymed, suggesting that Chaucer had either expanded his lexical resources or become more willing to accept approximate rhymes.

### 6.2 Increased Formal Control

In *The Canterbury Tales*, Chaucer’s meter is more regular, and his rhyme placement more strategic. Rhyme no longer appears to constrain meaning but rather to reinforce narrative voice and character [21]. The earlier hesitation to rhyme certain words in *The Book of the Duchess* thus highlights the poem’s transitional status in Chaucer’s development.

## 7. Textual Evidence and Scholarly Commentary

### 7.1 Manuscript Evidence

Surviving manuscripts of *The Book of the Duchess* show remarkable consistency in passages containing potentially unrhymed words, suggesting that the phenomenon is authorial rather than scribal [22]. This strengthens the argument that Chaucer deliberately avoided or failed to rhyme certain words.

### 7.2 Scholarly Interpretations

Scholars such as Derek Pearsall and David Lawton have noted Chaucer’s early sensitivity to the limits of English rhyme [23]. Pearsall argues that Chaucer’s early poetry reveals “a poet discovering what English will and will not do,” particularly in relation to French-derived forms [24]. The rhyme resistance of words like *sorwe* exemplifies this discovery process.

## 8. Conclusion

*The Book of the Duchess* stands at a critical juncture in the history of English poetry, where inherited Continental forms encounter the linguistic realities of Middle English. The apparent resistance of certain words—most notably *sorwe*—to rhyme in the poem reflects a convergence of phonetic limitation, metrical pressure, poetic intention, and linguistic experimentation. Whether viewed as a technical shortcoming or a meaningful formal choice, this phenomenon illuminates Chaucer’s role as a pioneering vernacular poet.

Comparison with *The Canterbury Tales* demonstrates that Chaucer ultimately overcame many of these early constraints, developing a more flexible and confident rhyme practice. The unrhymed or rhyme-resistant word in *The Book of the Duchess* thus serves not as a failure but as evidence of poetic growth, marking the moment when English verse began to test—and discover—its own formal possibilities.
