Write a professional academic paper on British counterintelligence operations during World War II, focusing specifically on the case of the Belgian refugee Andre Vernault, who was falsely believed to be a German spy after concealing his true profession. Establish Vernault’s profession, the interrogation context, the triggers of suspicion, and plausible reasons for concealment, clearly distinguishing fact from inference. Also, reconstruct a dated timeline of the case and summarize the methods and processes that led to suspicion and its resolution, locating the case within UK refugee screening and interrogation practice. The paper should include an analysis of broader implications with at least one comparison to a similar misidentification case. All claims must be supported by traceable primary or reputable secondary sources with page-level citations.
