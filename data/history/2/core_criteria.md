"Core understanding
The paper must demonstrate accurate knowledge of British counterintelligence structures and wartime refugee-screening/interrogation practices. It must illustrate a comprehensive account of Vernault’s case: the interrogation context, his true profession, suspicion triggers, and reasons for concealment, specifying broader implications drawn from the case.

Required sources & provenance
The report must use traceable, verifiable British counterintelligence or policing sources (for example, MI5, MI6, Special Branch, Home Office, or Aliens Registration files) or reputable secondary works that reproduce or quote these archives. It must present an evidence-based reconstruction of events with page-level or file-ID citations (e.g., interrogation reports, intelligence summaries, refugee registers). Where sources disagree, the paper must explicitly note contradictions and explain how reliability was assessed (e.g., contemporaneity, provenance, authorship).

Legal, social, and economic context (topic-specific)
The paper should specify the relevant legislation governing abortion in Britain during WWII and the penalties associated with practicing abortion. It must illustrate contemporary societal stigma, supported by relevant newspaper articles evidencing public attitudes. It should include employment records and statistics pertinent to refugee employment availability and poverty levels.

Analysis & comparisons
The paper must illuminate intelligence bias, wartime paranoia, and procedural flaws by examining motives, assumptions, and counterintelligence processes evident in the case. The paper should contain at least one comparable misidentification case to contextualize patterns and divergences.

Synthesis & conclusion
The paper must demonstrate the use of multiple appropriate primary and secondary sources to substantiate claims. The paper must illustrate how the case informs larger themes of wartime intelligence, refugee treatment, and the broader ethical implications. All conclusions must be grounded in verifiable evidence with traceable citations.
