Write a professional academic paper on the parameterized counting problem   $\#\mathsf{Sub}_\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{H})$ 
Input A graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$ and a graph $H \in \mathcal{H}$,
Parameter: $|H|$, Output: The number of subgraphs of }_\mathcal{G} isomorphic to $H$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is a somewhere-dense, subgraph-closed class not equal to all graphs and  {$\mathcal{H}$ is recursively enumerable.

The paper should include:
- a precise complexity classification claim with an explicit scope.
- a comparative analysis of how host-class properties and pattern structure influence tractability or hardness.
- a mathematical outline supporting the claim, including resource bounds and parameter dependence.
- a brief illustrative example that sanity-checks the reasoning.
