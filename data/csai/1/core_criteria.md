1. Identification of Computational Cost Components
The report must derive the computational cost from first principles by analyzing the underlying matrix operations. The analysis must explicitly distinguish between the two primary sources of cost: the self-attention mechanism, identifying it as the source of the quadratic (\(O(L^2)\)) scaling component, and the FFN/linear projections, identifying them as the source of the linear (\(O(L)\)) scaling component. Count the $O(L)$ component as the FFN plus the attention projections (Q/K/V and output)—i.e., the $O(L\,d_{\text{model}}^{2})$ matmuls that populate the $B$ term. Provide per-layer accounting that assigns the quadratic $O(L^{2})$ portion to score computation, softmax, and value mixing, clearly separating these from projection/FFN costs.

2. Derivation of the Per-Token Cost Model
The analysis must include a formal derivation that transitions from the sequence-level cost to a per-token cost model. The report must demonstrate how the sequence-level costs lead to a simplified linear model for the cost per token, structured as \(C_{\text{token}}(L) = AL + B\), and identify which architectural parameters contribute to the length-dependent term (\(A\)) and the fixed-cost term (\(B\)). Express $A$ and $B$ symbolically as functions of $n_{\text{layers}}, n_{\text{heads}}, d_{\text{model}}, d_{\text{ff}}$; state the FLOP counting convention (e.g., GEMM cost $2mkn$); and clarify that you are modeling training compute (forward + backward) by introducing a constant factor $\kappa$ ($\approx 2\text{–}3$) that multiplies both scenarios and thus cancels in ratios.

3. Analysis of the Fixed Token Budget Constraint
The report must explicitly state and analyze the core constraint of maintaining a constant total number of training tokens. It must include a logical argument demonstrating that under this constraint, the ratio of total computational costs between two scenarios is equivalent to the ratio of their respective per-token costs.

4. Application of the Model to the Case Study
The report must correctly apply the derived per-token cost model and the fixed-token-budget logic to the specific case study (increasing context length from \(L$ to \(4L\)). The report should correctly set up the mathematical formulation for the ratio of the additional cost to the original cost, using the previously defined terms and constraints. State which term ($AL$ vs $B$) dominates for the given $d_{\text{model}}, d_{\text{ff}}$ regime (assuming a standard transformer with softmax attention)
