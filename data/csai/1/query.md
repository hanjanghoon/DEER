Generate a comprehensive technical report analyzing the computational scaling properties of pretraining a standard transformer-based language model. The report must focus on the relationship between key architectural parameters (such as context length \(L\), model dimension \(d_{\text{model}}\), and feed-forward dimension \(d_{\text{ff}}\)) and the total computational cost (FLOPs). The report must include an examination of the distinct computational scaling behaviors of the self-attention and feed-forward network components and discuss the practical implications of these findings for training large language models. As a central case study, the report must analyze the scenario where a model’s pretraining context length is increased from \(L\) to \(4L\), while the total number of training tokens is held constant. The objective is to determine the resulting change in total computational cost relative to the original.
