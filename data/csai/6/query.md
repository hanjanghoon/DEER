Write a structured expert report on the King of the Hill chess position given by FEN: 8/2k5/5pn1/1Pp1pNpp/3PP3/4K1B1/8/8 w - - 0 43. In this variant, a player can win by checkmate or by legally moving their king onto one of the four central squares (d4, e4, d5, e5). Assume optimal play for both sides.

Your report must:
- Briefly restate the variant’s winning condition and how it alters evaluation priorities compared with classical chess.

- Interpret the FEN into a concise position summary (side to move, piece locations that matter, immediate tactical/strategic features).

-State the move-count convention you will use (full moves counted by White’s turns, not plies) and define “optimal play” (e.g., game-theoretic minimax).

-Present a rigorous analysis that identifies a forced winning method for White and calculates the minimal number of moves required under optimal defense. Where relevant, compare alternative candidate lines and explain why they do not yield a faster win.

-Justify minimality (why no faster win exists) using concrete refutations or bounding arguments.

-End with a single, explicit integer for the minimal number of moves in which White can win under the stated convention, plus one-sentence rationale.
