Write a detailed and professional academic paper on the computational and semantic properties of ""relaxed simulation"" induced by component-wise (Cartesian) abstraction over finite product state spaces. Include analysis of soundness, precision, complexity, the role of locality, and at least one algorithmic mitigation strategy, analyzed for its assumptions, trade-offs, and limitations. Include the following formal scenario as a case study within the analysis: Pairwise-disjoint finite sets $V_1,\dots,V_n$; concrete state space $\mathbb{S} = V_1\times\cdots\times V_n$; transition map $f:\mathbb{S}\to\mathbb{S}$ with ordinary trajectory $s_{i+1}=f(s_i)$; union domain $\mathbb{D}=\bigcup_k V_k$; decomposition $\mathscr{D}:2^{\mathbb{S}}\to2^{\mathbb{D}}$ defined by component extraction; recomposition $\mathscr{C}:2^{\mathbb{D}}\to2^{\mathbb{S}}$ per the three rules (fill missing coordinates with $V_k$; branch on multi-valued coordinates; unique product when all coordinates are singleton); relaxed iteration $\sigma_0=\mathscr{D}(s_0),\sigma_{i+1}=\sigma_i\cup\bigcup_{s\in\mathscr{C}(\sigma_i)}\mathscr{D}(f(s))$.
