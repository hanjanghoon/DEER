Write a professional academic report that investigates the relationship between the L1-constrained and L1-penalized formulations of the Lasso regression problem. The report should analyze under what mathematical conditions the two formulations yield equivalent solution sets, how their solution paths behave as parameters change, and what implications arise in edge cases. 

Explicitly write both formulations, derive the Lagrangian and KKT conditions to test any $t\!\leftrightarrow\!\lambda$ correspondence (distinguishing binding vs. slack constraints), state any preprocessing/scaling of $X$ and $y$, and, if including a numerical illustration, report KKT residuals or primal–dual gaps and solver tolerances.

The discussion should be framed in rigorous mathematical language, supported by optimization theory, and written in full sentences and paragraphs. The style should balance technical clarity with conceptual explanation.
