Write a rigorous report on Support Vector Machines that (i) precisely defines the hard- and soft-margin primal/dual problems, support vectors, margin geometry, and kernel-induced feature spaces; (ii) states assumptions on separability, class balance, convexity, and solution uniqueness; (iii) derives KKT conditions and uses them to test some hypotheses—feasibility of one-class support-vector sets, effects of class imbalance on margins/thresholds, invariance of the decision boundary to perturbations of non-support-vector points until they reach the margin, and conditions for uniqueness; and (iv) evaluates at least one linear and one nonlinear kernel, verifying PSD/Mercer where relevant. For any experiments, specify dataset construction, preprocessing, hyperparameter protocol, and seeds; report margin statistics, hinge loss, and at least one imbalance-aware metric. Tie conclusions to assumptions; discuss limitations (scalability, noise, kernel dependence) with evidence-based mitigations.
