Write a research report that explores the conditions under which value iteration in Markov Decision Processes converges geometrically to the optimal value function. Your report should provide precise definitions of the key concepts involved, examine the role of rewards and discounting in ensuring convergence, and analyze both theoretical and practical factors that influence the behavior of the algorithm. Discuss circumstances where convergence occurs, where it may fail, and highlight open questions or limitations. The report should be structured as a rigorous technical investigation, integrating mathematical reasoning, conceptual explanations, and illustrative examples to support the analysis.
