# Isolation and Culture of Primary Mouse Corneal Stromal Fibroblasts (Keratocytes): A Reproducible Protocol with Biological and Technical Validation

## Abstract

Primary corneal stromal fibroblasts, commonly referred to as keratocytes or keratocyte-derived fibroblasts depending on activation state, are essential cellular models for investigating corneal development, wound healing, fibrosis, and stromal immunobiology. Despite their widespread use, published protocols for isolating and culturing mouse corneal stromal fibroblasts vary substantially in enzymatic strategy, tissue handling, and validation criteria, leading to variability in yield, purity, and phenotypic stability. This manuscript presents a detailed, reproducible protocol for the isolation and in vitro culture of primary corneal stromal fibroblasts from murine corneal tissue. The protocol integrates biological rationale with technical justification for each critical step, including tissue dissection, enzymatic digestion, cell plating, culture conditions, and passaging. Emphasis is placed on minimizing epithelial and endothelial contamination, preserving stromal cell identity, and managing activation states. Quality-control checkpoints, molecular and functional validation strategies, and ethical considerations for animal use are explicitly described. This protocol is designed to support reproducible isolation of high-purity stromal fibroblast populations suitable for mechanistic, translational, and comparative studies.

## Background and Rationale

### The Corneal Stroma and Keratocyte Biology

The cornea is a transparent, avascular tissue composed of three principal cellular layers: the stratified epithelium, the collagen-rich stroma, and the monolayer endothelium. The stroma accounts for approximately 90% of corneal thickness and is populated predominantly by keratocytes, a specialized population of quiescent mesenchymal cells responsible for maintaining extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and corneal transparency [1]. Keratocytes exhibit a unique transcriptional and metabolic profile characterized by expression of corneal crystallins (e.g., ALDH3A1), keratan sulfate proteoglycans (lumican, keratocan), and low proliferative activity under homeostatic conditions [2].

Upon injury or inflammatory stimulation, keratocytes undergo phenotypic transition into activated fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, acquiring migratory and proliferative properties and expressing markers such as vimentin, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and type I collagen [3]. In vitro isolation and culture inherently induce partial activation; therefore, protocol design must balance efficient cell recovery with controlled phenotypic drift.

### Need for a Standardized, Reproducible Isolation Protocol

Mouse models are central to corneal biology due to the availability of genetic tools and disease models. However, the small size of the mouse cornea (~2.6 mm diameter) presents technical challenges, including low cell yield and high risk of epithelial or endothelial contamination [4]. Published protocols vary in:

* Enzymatic digestion strategy (collagenase, dispase, trypsin, or combinations)
* Duration and temperature of digestion
* Inclusion or exclusion of epithelial and endothelial layers
* Culture media composition and serum concentration
* Validation criteria for stromal identity

These inconsistencies complicate cross-study comparisons and undermine reproducibility. The present protocol aims to resolve these issues by providing a rigorously justified, stepwise workflow with embedded validation checkpoints.

## Experimental Design Overview

### Conceptual Workflow

The protocol consists of the following major stages:

1. **Animal preparation and corneal harvest**
2. **Selective removal of epithelium and endothelium**
3. **Enzymatic digestion of stromal ECM**
4. **Cell recovery and plating**
5. **Primary culture and expansion**
6. **Phenotypic validation and quality control**

Each stage incorporates decision points informed by corneal biology and prior methodological studies.

---

### Key Design Principles

* **Layer specificity**: Mechanical and enzymatic steps are optimized to enrich stromal cells while minimizing epithelial and endothelial carryover.
* **Mild enzymatic digestion**: Collagenase-based digestion preserves cell surface markers and viability better than harsh proteases [5].
* **Controlled activation**: Serum concentration and substrate stiffness are chosen to support fibroblast survival while limiting excessive myofibroblast differentiation.
* **Reproducibility**: Precise timings, reagent concentrations, and handling conditions are specified.
* **Validation**: Molecular, immunocytochemical, and functional assays confirm cell identity and purity.

## Materials and Reagents

### Animals

* Adult C57BL/6J mice, 6–10 weeks old, male or female
  (age range chosen to balance stromal cellularity and tissue integrity) [6]

---

### Reagents

* Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), calcium- and magnesium-free
* Dispase II (neutral protease, ≥1.0 U/mg)
* Collagenase type I or type II
* Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), high glucose
* Fetal bovine serum (FBS), heat-inactivated
* Penicillin–streptomycin
* Trypan blue
* Trypsin-EDTA (0.05%)
* Paraformaldehyde (4%)
* Antibodies for validation (e.g., anti-vimentin, anti-keratocan, anti-α-SMA)
* RNA extraction kit (for gene expression analysis)

All reagents should be sourced from validated suppliers and lot numbers recorded to support reproducibility.

---

## Equipment

* Dissecting microscope
* Fine forceps (Dumont #5)
* Vannas scissors
* 35 mm and 60 mm culture dishes
* CO₂ incubator (37 °C, 5% CO₂)
* Centrifuge with swinging-bucket rotor
* Biosafety cabinet
* Inverted phase-contrast microscope

---

## Ethical Compliance

All animal procedures must be approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) or equivalent body and conform to national and international guidelines for laboratory animal welfare [7]. Euthanasia should be performed using approved methods (e.g., CO₂ inhalation followed by cervical dislocation). The number of animals should be minimized consistent with experimental requirements, and corneas from both eyes of each mouse may be used to reduce animal usage.

---

## Procedure

### A. Corneal Harvest

1. Euthanize the mouse according to approved protocols.
2. Enucleate both eyes immediately using curved forceps.
3. Place eyes in cold sterile PBS.

**Rationale:** Rapid processing minimizes post-mortem degradation and preserves cell viability [8].

---

### B. Removal of Epithelium and Endothelium

1. Under a dissecting microscope, remove extraocular tissues.
2. Incubate whole corneas in dispase II (2 mg/mL in PBS) at 4 °C overnight or at 37 °C for 60 min.
3. Gently peel off the epithelial sheet using fine forceps.
4. Mechanically scrape the endothelial layer from the posterior surface.

**Rationale:** Dispase selectively cleaves basement membrane components, enabling clean separation of epithelium while preserving stromal integrity [9]. Mechanical removal of endothelium prevents contamination by non-proliferative endothelial cells.

---

### C. Stromal Digestion

1. Mince stromal tissue into ~0.5 mm fragments.
2. Incubate in collagenase solution (1–2 mg/mL in DMEM) at 37 °C for 1.5–2 h with gentle agitation.
3. Triturate gently every 30 min.
4. Stop digestion by adding DMEM with 10% FBS.

**Rationale:** Collagenase efficiently degrades stromal ECM while preserving fibroblast viability and surface antigens [5].

---

### D. Cell Recovery

1. Filter cell suspension through a 70 µm strainer.
2. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.
3. Resuspend pellet in complete culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + antibiotics).

---

### E. Primary Culture

1. Plate cells onto tissue-culture-treated dishes.
2. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO₂.
3. Replace medium after 24 h to remove debris.
4. Change medium every 2–3 days thereafter.

**Rationale:** Adherent culture selectively enriches fibroblasts due to their attachment properties [10].

---

### F. Passaging

* Passage cells at 70–80% confluence using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA.
* Use cells between passages 1–4 for experiments.

**Rationale:** Extended passaging increases risk of phenotypic drift and myofibroblast differentiation [11].

---

## Validation and Quality Control

### Morphological Assessment

Primary stromal fibroblasts display spindle-shaped, elongated morphology with prominent actin filaments under phase-contrast microscopy [12].

---

### Immunophenotyping

* Positive markers: vimentin, keratocan (early passage)
* Negative markers: cytokeratin (epithelium), ZO-1 (endothelium)

Immunostaining or flow cytometry can be used for quantitative assessment [13].

---

### Gene Expression Analysis

RT-qPCR for stromal markers (Kera, Lum, Aldh3a1) and activation markers (Acta2) provides molecular confirmation of identity and activation state [2].

---

### Functional Assays

* Migration assays (scratch wound)
* Collagen gel contraction (to assess myofibroblast differentiation)

---

## Applications

* Corneal wound healing studies
* Fibrosis and scarring models
* Genetic manipulation in vitro
* Drug screening for anti-fibrotic agents

---

## Conclusion

This protocol provides a biologically informed, methodologically justified, and validation-driven approach to isolating and culturing primary mouse corneal stromal fibroblasts. By explicitly addressing reproducibility, quality control, and ethical compliance, it supports reliable cross-laboratory implementation and robust downstream experimentation.
