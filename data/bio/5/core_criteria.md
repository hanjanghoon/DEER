The protocol manuscript must provide a complete, reproducible method for isolating and validating primary corneal stromal fibroblasts from mouse tissue, suitable for Bio-protocol Journal submission.

1. Complete Experimental Workflow
The protocol must span the entire process from animal tissue procurement through validated cell culture with no critical procedural gaps. This includes: animal euthanasia method compliant with institutional standards; mouse strain/age parameters or justification for flexibility; corneal dissection technique with anatomical landmarks; tissue layer preparation strategy (such as debridement approach with rationale); primary isolation method with complete parameters (if enzymatic: enzyme type, concentration, duration, temperature, agitation; if explant: tissue preparation, adherence conditions, outgrowth timeline); cell separation to single-cell suspension where applicable; initial seeding density with justification; passage protocol including dissociation method and split ratios; and maximum passage number for maintaining primary characteristics.

2. Methodological Decision Framework and Rationale
The protocol must address key methodological choices that impact isolation success and cell phenotype. This includes explicit discussion of tissue layer preparation strategies (which layers to remove and why), isolation method selection (enzymatic vs. explant) with rationale based on intended applications or outcomes, and culture medium formulation decisions with justification for serum composition choices (serum-free vs. serum-supplemented, specific concentrations) and explanation of how these choices affect cell adhesion, proliferation, or phenotype maintenance.

3. Validation Framework
The protocol must include comprehensive validation to confirm cell identity and functional competence. This requires: morphological validation with at least one criterion specific to corneal stromal fibroblasts (e.g., spindle-shaped morphology, lack of epithelial cobblestone pattern); molecular validation using at least two positive markers for fibroblast identity (e.g., vimentin, keratocan, ALDH3A1) and at least one negative marker to exclude contaminating cell types (e.g., cytokeratin for epithelial, CD31 for endothelial); specification of validation methodologies for each marker (immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, qPCR, Western blot); and at least one functional assay demonstrating characteristic fibroblast behavior (e.g., collagen production, contractility, wound healing capacity, TGF-β response) with defined success criteria.

4. Technical Reproducibility Specifications
All procedural steps must include quantitative specifications sufficient for independent reproduction. This includes: specific values with units for all reagent concentrations; temperature, duration, and atmospheric conditions (CO₂ percentage where relevant) for all incubation steps; centrifugation parameters (speed in ×g, duration, temperature); volumes scaled appropriately (per cornea, per tissue mass, or per culture vessel); complete reagent specifications (formal name, supplier or equivalent specification, catalog number or chemical grade); equipment specifications (type/model or functional specifications for equivalent substitution); and distinction between brand-specific requirements and acceptable alternatives.

5. Quality Control Framework and Troubleshooting
The protocol must define measurable outcomes and provide guidance for assessing progress and diagnosing problems. This includes: expected cell yield per cornea (range or typical value); expected timeline to confluent primary culture from initial isolation; acceptable initial viability threshold; identification of at least three critical assessment checkpoints in the workflow with specified observables, success indicators vs. problem indicators, and decision criteria for proceeding vs. addressing issues; and troubleshooting guidance for at least three common failure modes (e.g., low yield, contamination, wrong cell type enrichment, attachment failure) with diagnostic indicators, likely root causes, and corrective/preventive strategies.

6. Corneal Tissue-Specific Expertise
The protocol must demonstrate specialized understanding distinguishing this from generic cell isolation methods. This includes: addressing anatomical challenges specific to corneal tissue affecting isolation efficiency or purity; defining the target corneal cell phenotype (stromal fibroblasts, keratocytes, or myofibroblasts) and explaining how the protocol achieves or maintains this versus alternative differentiation states; addressing primary cell population heterogeneity; explaining primary cell lifespan limitations and senescence indicators relevant to this cell type; distinguishing between freshly isolated (P0) and cultured primary cells (P1+) with expected phenotypic changes; and providing strategy for detecting non-fibroblast contamination (epithelial, endothelial, immune cells).

7. Safety and Ethical Compliance
The protocol must address relevant safety and ethical considerations including: biohazard classification for primary tissue handling; PPE requirements; sharps safety for dissection; biological waste disposal; hazardous reagent warnings (enzymes, fixatives); requirement for IACUC approval; reference to animal welfare guidelines; and humane euthanasia standards compliance.
