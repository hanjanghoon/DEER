Write an expert technical report on allelic inclusion in naive B and T lymphocytes as measured by droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing, analyzing the mechanisms underlying dual light chain expression in B cells and dual alpha chain expression in T cells, separately. These observations show substantially different rates: approximately 1% of B cell barcodes display dual light chains while approximately 30% of T cell barcodes display dual alpha chains.

The report must include:
- Analysis of biological and technical mechanisms that produce observed dual-chain populations, evaluating which mechanisms are significant contributors for B cells versus T cells separately
- Explanation of the developmental biology underlying the substantial difference in allelic inclusion rates between B and T cells, including receptor rearrangement processes and selection checkpoint requirements
- Explanation of how the identified mechanisms combine to produce the observed dual-chain rates (~1% for B cells, ~30% for T cells), distinguishing biological allelic inclusion from technical artifacts
- Experimental approaches for validating true allelic inclusion and determining functional status of dual receptors
