The report must provide comprehensive mechanistic analysis of dual-chain observations in scRNA-seq data, rigorously distinguishing biological allelic inclusion from technical artifacts and explaining cell-type-specific patterns.

1. Biological Framework for Allelic Exclusion and Inclusion
The report must explain how V(D)J recombination and receptor gene rearrangement normally produce single receptor expression through allelic exclusion. This requires describing the molecular mechanisms that prevent or terminate further rearrangement after successful receptor expression (e.g., feedback inhibition, receptor editing limitations). The report must then define allelic inclusion as the biological exception where cells express two functional light or alpha chains, distinguishing this from technical artifacts or non-functional transcript expression. The framework must establish when in development light/alpha chain rearrangement occurs and under what conditions second chains are generated.

2. Mechanism-Specific Analysis for B Cells and T Cells
The report must analyze potential mechanisms that produce dual-chain observations separately for B cells and T cells, determining which contribute significantly (>1%) to observed populations. The analysis must address at least the following mechanisms:
(a) Doublet events (two cells in one droplet): Must explain why doublets occur in droplet-based platforms, cite typical doublet rates, and assess whether this contributes >1% for both cell types.
(b) Ambient RNA or false transcript detection (e.g., background RNA, barcode swapping/index hopping): Must explain this technical artifact, evaluate whether platform error rates produce >1% false signals, and justify significance.
(c) Both chains fully functional and surface-expressed: Must address whether dual functional surface receptors occur at >1% frequency in naive cells for each cell type, with biological justification.
(d) One chain fails to reach cell surface: Must explain biological mechanisms preventing surface expression (e.g., misfolding, retention), evaluate whether this occurs at >1% in each cell type, and explain B vs. T differences.
(e) One chain is autoreactive: Must explain autoreactive receptor elimination through negative selection, evaluate whether cells with one functional and one autoreactive chain survive to maturity at >1% frequency in each cell type, and explain differential rates.
(f) One chain surface-expressed but non-functional for other reasons: Must identify what distinguishes a "non-functional" surface-expressed, non-autoreactive receptor from a functional one, explain whether such receptors can exist at >1% frequency in B cells versus T cells separately with biological justification, and explain why this mechanism's relevance differs between the two cell types.

3. Developmental Biology Underlying B vs. T Cell Differences
The report must explain why allelic inclusion rates and mechanism profiles differ between B cells (~1%) and T cells (~30%). For B cells: must describe light chain rearrangement occurring only after successful heavy chain pairing, second light chain generation typically only if first fails, and positive selection requiring surface BCR expression without additional binding requirements. For T cells: must describe both alpha loci typically undergoing rearrangement, first successful alpha pairing with beta, second alpha potentially passing or failing independent checkpoints, and positive selection requiring productive MHC binding that many receptors fail despite surface expression. The explanation must connect developmental differences to why certain mechanisms contribute significantly in one cell type but not the other.

4. Integration of Mechanism Contributions to Observed Rates
The report must explain how multiple mechanisms combine to produce the observed dual-chain rates (~1% B cells, ~30% T cells). This requires: explaining how total observed rates represent sums of multiple contributing mechanisms; reasoning about which mechanisms must contribute significantly (>1%) to produce observed totals; explaining the ~30-fold difference based on biological mechanisms; and integrating that technical artifacts contribute similarly to both cell types while biological mechanisms differ. The analysis must demonstrate that proposed significant mechanisms are quantitatively consistent with observed rates.

5. Distinction Between Biological and Technical Sources
The report must explain how to distinguish true biological allelic inclusion from technical artifacts. This includes: computational approaches for doublet detection; methods for distinguishing ambient RNA from true mRNA; and orthogonal experimental validation (e.g., flow cytometry for dual surface expression, functional assays). The report must address why distinguishing these sources matters for interpreting immune repertoire diversity.

6. Receptor Development Checkpoints and Selection
The report must provide mechanistic detail about B and T cell development supporting the mechanism analysis. For B cells: sequence of heavy chain rearrangement, testing for successful expression, light chain rearrangement (kappa then lambda if needed), and positive selection requiring surface BCR without specific binding requirements. For T cells: beta chain rearrangement, alpha chain rearrangement from both alleles, positive selection requiring TCR-MHC interaction meeting affinity thresholds, and negative selection eliminating high-affinity self-reactive TCRs. Must explain how checkpoint stringencies affect which dual-chain mechanisms produce mature naive cells at significant frequencies.

7. Literature Integration and Empirical Support
The report must cite literature documenting allelic inclusion rates, explaining measurement methods from historical studies through modern scRNA-seq. Analysis of each mechanism must cite empirical evidence where available (e.g., doublet rates, dual receptor expression measurements, autoreactive receptor frequencies), or provide reasoning based on biological principles where direct empirical evidence is lacking. Claims about >1% contributions must be supported by quantitative reasoning grounded in documented rates or biological principles.

8. Functional Consequences and Biological Significance
The report must address functional implications of allelic inclusion for immune repertoire diversity and function. This includes: effects on receptor repertoire size and diversity; whether dual-receptor cells exhibit different functional properties compared to single-receptor cells (e.g., differences in binding specificity, signaling capacity, or activation thresholds), and evolutionary or developmental significance of the different allelic inclusion rates observed in B versus T cells.
