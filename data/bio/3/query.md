Write a comparative research paper on the detection of low-frequency sound (infrasound) across animal species, focusing on whether any non-human species can detect acoustic frequencies produced by human muscle twitches. The paper should particularly analyze the auditory physiology of whales, dogs, bats, and herring, explaining how their cochlear and neural adaptations determine frequency sensitivity. It should evaluate the physical limits of sound transmission in different media (air vs. water) and discuss how low-frequency hearing in whales evolved for long-distance underwater communication. The study must assess whether infrasound perception could extend to detecting biological signals and what ecological or communicative advantages this capability provides.
