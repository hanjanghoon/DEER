# Comparative Detection of Low-Frequency Sound Across Animal Species:

## Auditory Physiology, Infrasound Sensitivity, and the Limits of Biological Signal Perception

## Abstract

Low-frequency sound and infrasound play critical roles in animal communication, environmental sensing, and predator–prey interactions. Certain species, particularly large marine mammals and some fish, exhibit remarkable sensitivity to frequencies far below the lower limit of human hearing. This paper examines whether any non-human species could plausibly detect acoustic frequencies generated by human muscle twitches, which primarily produce extremely weak, low-frequency biomechanical signals. We conduct a comparative analysis of auditory physiology in whales, dogs, bats, and herring, focusing on cochlear mechanics, neural encoding strategies, and evolutionary adaptations shaping frequency sensitivity. We also analyze the physical constraints of sound transmission in air versus water and assess whether infrasound perception can extend beyond ecological signals to biologically incidental sources. Our findings indicate that while some species possess extraordinary low-frequency hearing, the detection of human muscle-generated acoustic signals is implausible under natural conditions due to amplitude, coupling, and environmental noise constraints. Low-frequency hearing instead evolved to optimize long-distance communication, environmental awareness, and group coordination, especially in aquatic environments.

## 1. Introduction

Sound perception is a fundamental sensory modality across animal taxa, enabling communication, navigation, and environmental monitoring. While human hearing is typically limited to frequencies between approximately 20 Hz and 20 kHz, many animals exhibit auditory sensitivities that extend well below or above this range [1]. Infrasound—defined as acoustic frequencies below 20 Hz—has been documented in several species, most notably large terrestrial mammals and cetaceans [2].

A provocative question occasionally arises in both scientific and popular discourse: can animals detect sounds produced by human muscle activity, such as involuntary muscle twitches? These twitches generate minute mechanical vibrations, often dominated by low-frequency components below the human auditory threshold. Addressing this question requires an integrated analysis of auditory physiology, sound physics, and ecological relevance.

This paper provides a comparative investigation of infrasound detection across whales, dogs, bats, and herring—species representing diverse ecological niches and auditory specializations. We examine whether their sensory systems could, even in principle, detect acoustic emissions from human muscle activity, and what evolutionary pressures have shaped their frequency sensitivity.

## 2. Physical Characteristics of Low-Frequency Sound

### 2.1 Definition and Properties of Infrasound

Infrasound refers to sound waves with frequencies below 20 Hz, characterized by long wavelengths and relatively low attenuation over distance [3]. For example, a 10 Hz sound wave in air has a wavelength of approximately 34 meters, while in water the wavelength exceeds 150 meters due to the higher speed of sound [4].

Low-frequency sound propagates efficiently through dense media and around obstacles, making it well suited for long-range communication and environmental sensing [5]. However, perception of such sound requires specialized auditory structures capable of detecting slow oscillations in pressure or particle motion.

### 2.2 Sound Transmission in Air vs. Water

The medium through which sound travels critically influences its detectability. Water is approximately 800 times denser than air, allowing sound waves—especially low-frequency ones—to propagate farther with less energy loss [6]. Additionally, underwater ambient noise at low frequencies is often dominated by natural sources such as waves, seismic activity, and biological signals, shaping the evolutionary tuning of aquatic auditory systems [7].

In contrast, low-frequency sound transmission in air suffers greater attenuation and is more susceptible to interference from turbulence and ground coupling effects [8]. These physical constraints severely limit the effective range of extremely weak sound sources, such as biological micro-vibrations.

## 3. Acoustic Characteristics of Human Muscle Twitches

### 3.1 Biomechanical Origin of Muscle Sound

Muscle contractions generate mechanical vibrations known as mechanomyographic (MMG) signals, typically in the frequency range of 2–50 Hz [9]. These signals arise from lateral oscillations of muscle fibers during contraction and are detectable only with direct-contact sensors placed on the skin [10].

Crucially, MMG signals are not efficiently radiated as airborne sound. Their amplitudes are extremely low, often on the order of micrometers of displacement, and rapidly attenuate within biological tissue [11].

### 3.2 Acoustic Radiation and Environmental Coupling

For a biological vibration to be detectable as sound by another organism, it must couple effectively into the surrounding medium and exceed ambient noise levels [12]. Human muscle twitches lack the surface area, impedance matching, and energy required to radiate detectable infrasound into air or water under natural conditions [13].

Thus, while muscle twitches contain low-frequency components, they are biomechanical signals rather than functional acoustic emissions.

## 4. Auditory Physiology and Frequency Sensitivity Across Species

### 4.1 Whales (Cetacea)

#### 4.1.1 Cochlear Adaptations

Baleen whales exhibit extreme low-frequency hearing sensitivity, with estimated lower thresholds reaching below 10 Hz [14]. Their cochleae are elongated and exhibit stiffness gradients optimized for low-frequency resonance, allowing efficient transduction of slow pressure oscillations [15].

#### 4.1.2 Neural Encoding and Long-Distance Communication

Whales produce and perceive infrasonic calls that can travel hundreds to thousands of kilometers underwater [16]. Neural phase-locking mechanisms enable precise encoding of low-frequency temporal patterns, critical for communication across ocean basins [17].

These adaptations evolved under strong selective pressure for long-distance communication in a vast, visually limited environment.

### 4.2 Dogs (Canis familiaris)

Dogs possess auditory sensitivity extending lower than humans, with thresholds around 15–20 Hz under optimal conditions [18]. However, their auditory system is primarily adapted for enhanced high-frequency hearing, supporting sound localization and predator–prey interactions [19].

Low-frequency detection in dogs is limited by cochlear mechanics and does not approach the sensitivity observed in large mammals like whales or elephants [20].

### 4.3 Bats (Chiroptera)

Bats are auditory specialists at the opposite end of the frequency spectrum. Their hearing is optimized for ultrasonic echolocation, often exceeding 100 kHz [21]. Cochlear specializations emphasize extreme high-frequency resolution at the expense of low-frequency sensitivity [22].

Consequently, bats are among the least capable mammals for infrasound perception, as their auditory filters strongly attenuate low-frequency input [23].

### 4.4 Herring (Clupea harengus)

Herring possess a unique auditory system among fish, featuring gas-filled bullae connected to the inner ear, enhancing sensitivity to low-frequency sound pressure [24]. They can detect frequencies as low as a few hertz and are sensitive to particle motion as well as pressure fluctuations [25].

This capability supports predator detection and schooling behavior, allowing rapid responses to distant disturbances [26].

## 5. Evolutionary Origins of Low-Frequency Hearing

### 5.1 Adaptive Advantages in Aquatic Environments

Low-frequency hearing in whales and some fish evolved primarily for long-distance communication and environmental awareness in water, where such signals propagate efficiently [27]. Infrasound enables coordination over large spatial scales, mate attraction, and navigation [28].

### 5.2 Constraints and Trade-offs

Auditory systems face trade-offs between frequency range, sensitivity, and resolution. Specialization for low-frequency hearing often comes at the cost of high-frequency acuity, reflecting ecological priorities rather than generalized sensitivity [29].

## 6. Could Animals Detect Human Muscle Twitches?

### 6.1 Theoretical Considerations

Even the most sensitive low-frequency auditory systems require signals that exceed environmental noise and couple efficiently into the medium [30]. Human muscle twitches fail on both counts: their acoustic radiation is negligible, and their energy dissipates rapidly within the body [31].

### 6.2 Species-Specific Assessment

* **Whales:** Despite extreme infrasound sensitivity, whales are unlikely to detect human muscle twitches due to insufficient signal amplitude and lack of underwater coupling.
* **Dogs:** Auditory thresholds and air-based transmission constraints preclude detection.
* **Bats:** Physiologically incapable due to high-frequency specialization.
* **Herring:** While sensitive to low-frequency particle motion, detection would require direct water coupling and unrealistically high signal strength.

No known non-human species possesses the combined sensitivity, coupling, and ecological incentive to detect such signals.

## 7. Ecological and Communicative Significance of Infrasound

Low-frequency hearing provides substantial advantages in detecting large-scale environmental events, predators, and conspecific signals [32]. Its function is inherently ecological and communicative, not incidental or forensic. Evolution has not favored the detection of biologically irrelevant micro-signals lacking adaptive value [33].

---

## 8. Conclusion

Comparative analysis across whales, dogs, bats, and herring demonstrates that infrasound detection is a highly specialized adaptation shaped by ecological demands and physical constraints. While some species exhibit extraordinary sensitivity to low-frequency sound, this capability evolved to support long-distance communication, environmental monitoring, and survival-critical behaviors.

Human muscle twitches, although containing low-frequency components, do not produce acoustically meaningful signals capable of being detected by non-human animals. The limits of sound transmission, coupled with auditory physiology and evolutionary logic, firmly exclude this possibility. Infrasound perception remains a powerful but purpose-driven sensory adaptation, finely tuned to the ecological realities of each species.
