1. Introduction and Research Context
The paper must clearly define the challenge of inferring phylogenetic relationships from morphological data using Maximum Parsimony, particularly in groups with recent or cryptic divergence. It must articulate why geometric morphometrics is a valuable framework for representing shape variation and discuss its potential and limitations compared with molecular approaches. A clear statement of research objectives should be provided.

2. Theoretical and Methodological Foundations
The paper must review the principles of Maximum Parsimony and geometric morphometrics, explaining how morphological traits or shape variables can be encoded for phylogenetic analysis. It must discuss assumptions, data types (continuous vs. discrete), and issues such as homoplasy, convergence, and trait coding. The paper should review prior comparative studies between morphological and molecular trees to establish context.

3. Data and Analytical Framework
The paper must outline a rigorous framework for collecting, coding, and analyzing geometric morphometric data for phylogenetic inference. It should describe how shape data can be converted into a matrix for parsimony analysis, including considerations of character definition, weighting, and treatment of missing data. The paper should explain the approach for assessing congruence between morphological and molecular trees in conceptual and methodological terms (e.g., topological comparison, support metrics), without prescribing a specific dataset or algorithm.

4. Results and Comparative Interpretation
The paper must present and interpret outcomes from both morphological and molecular analyses (empirical or hypothetical), identifying areas of congruence and incongruence between tree structures. It must evaluate potential sources of disagreement (e.g., homoplasy, developmental constraint, recent divergence) and interpret what these results imply about the information content and evolutionary signal in morphometric data.

5. Conclusions and Broader Implications
The paper must summarize the insights gained regarding the relationship between morphological and molecular phylogenies, evaluating the robustness and limits of geometric morphometrics within parsimony frameworks. It should connect findings to broader evolutionary and methodological questions (e.g., tempo of morphological change, integration of data types) and propose directions for further research, such as expanding to likelihood-based methods or integrating ecological traits.
