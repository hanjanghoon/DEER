Introduction
The paper must clearly define the research problem and articulate the scientific motivation. The introduction must establish the objectives of the study, including a strong historical and theoretical grounding in zoological nomenclature and taxonomic revision processes must be presented, including definitions of synonymy, priority, and validity under the ICZN. A hypothesis or guiding question must be explicit.

Related Research
The literature review must discuss taxonomic synonymy and nomenclatural stability within Hymenoptera, emphasizing the families represented in Cresson’s dataset. It must reference both classical taxonomic literature (19th–20th centuries) and modern systematic revisions, demonstrating the historical evolution of species classification methods. The review should analyze drivers of synonymization, such as morphological redundancy, misinterpretation of sexual dimorphism, incomplete type descriptions, and later molecular reclassification. Comparative discussion should be made between morphological taxonomy and phylogenetic systematics, showing how each framework has contributed to synonym resolution. Sources must be contextualized, explaining how each work informs or challenges the current analysis rather than merely being cited. The literature review should reflect awareness of key catalogues and databases as foundational to verifying taxonomic status.

Data / Experimental Design
The dataset must include the 22 species entries from Cresson’s 1872 survey, with appropriate documentation of species names, collectors, and historical citations. The methodology must describe how each species was cross-referenced against modern taxonomic sources to determine current validity. The criteria for synonymization must be clearly stated. Exclusion criteria should be defined. The paper must demonstrate procedural reproducibility, specifying all sources consulted, dates of access, and validation protocols. Analytical scope must remain empirical, emphasizing data verification rather than speculative interpretation.

Results Analysis
The paper must explicitly identify which species names were synonymized as of 2020. Quantitative findings must include the proportion or percentage of synonymized taxa relative to the total dataset. Analytical commentary must address patterns of synonymization, such as concentration within specific genera. The paper should interpret causal mechanisms, including genus-level reorganization, improved diagnostic morphology, and molecular corroboration. Discussion should relate synonymization events to historical taxonomic practices. The results section must transition into a critical analysis of implications, not just enumeration, showing what synonymization reveals about the evolution of taxonomic methods.

Conclusion and Implications
The conclusion must synthesize the findings, summarizing the overall rate and nature of synonymization within Cresson’s dataset. It should reflect on how these changes exemplify the fluidity and self-correcting nature of biological classification systems. The paper must articulate broader implications of biodiversity informatics, museum curation, and historical data integration, stressing why historical synonym tracking is essential for ecological and conservation research. Methodological implications should address the value of maintaining cross-referenced taxonomic metadata in global databases. The study must acknowledge its limitations and propose future direction, such as expanding the analysis to other historical faunal lists or integrating phylogenetic and molecular data for deeper evolutionary context. The conclusion must close the research loop by linking the empirical findings back to the motivations and hypotheses presented in the introduction.
