Write an empirical research paper in systematic entomology investigating the taxonomic synonymization of Hymenopteran species listed in E. T. Cresson’s 1872 survey of Texas. The study should analyze which of the originally described species names remain valid and which have been synonymized as of 2020. Discuss the historical and methodological causes of synonymization, including early morphological misclassification, later genus reorganization, and modern molecular phylogenetic insights. The paper should include sections on introduction, related research on synonymy in Symphyta taxonomy, dataset and methodology for cross-referencing species validity, quantitative results on synonymized taxa, and a conclusion interpreting the implications of taxonomic instability for biodiversity databases and historical biogeography.
