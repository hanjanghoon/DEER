While it does distinguish attention (quadratic in L via the QK^T and AV matmuls) from FFN/projections (linear in L), it does not provide the EG-required per-layer accounting that explicitly assigns the O(L^2) portion to score computation, softmax, and value mixing while explicitly grouping the O(L·d_model^2) terms as the full “B-term” components (FFN + Q/K/V + output). The report also fails the EG requirement to express A and B symbolically as functions of n_layers, n_heads, d_model, d_ff (it leaves them as big-O / informal expressions, largely omitting n_heads and not giving explicit A,B). It states an FMA convention and mentions a ~3× training factor, but it does not introduce the κ factor in the required way (as a constant multiplying both scenarios that cancels in ratios) nor does it state a GEMM rule like 2mkn. Finally, the fixed-token-budget logic is partly present (T fixed, sequences = T/L), but it does not explicitly prove the EG-required statement that the total-cost ratio equals the per-token-cost ratio under fixed T. With multiple core EG misses, per Coverage Scoring Guidelines this is in the 3–4 band (“multiple core gaps”).",
