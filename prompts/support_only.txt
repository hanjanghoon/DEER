You are an expert fact-checker. Verify the following claims against the provided context.
Be extremely strict. High precision is required.

For each claim, determine if it is supported by the context.
Result should be based on **semantic meaning**, not just keyword matching. If the text implies the claim is true, mark it as supported.

**Verification Result (`result`)**:
- **supported**: The text explicitly states or clearly implies the claim is true.
- **conflict**: The text explicitly contradicts the claim.
- **not_supported**: The text does not contain enough information.

# Examples:
